    "title": "＊✿❀ ☁️ SUMMER KETAMINE RITUAL 🍒 ❀✿＊",
    "text": "Over summer, I do ketamine 6 times in one week with an 80 year old anesthesiologist. He says we’re fixing my hard drive. Pills are for software issues. Ketamine loves estrogen, he emphasizes. His sloth-covered office. A pretty girl like you, he says, should feel like a Disney Princess. I laugh, never showing my teeth.\nThe ritual goes as follows,\n1.  Eat a bowl of oatmeal. Drink a small yellow Gatorade. Arrive.\n2.  Public restrooms circle Hell. Pee in Hell.\na. Avoid pissing your pants in Not Hell.\n3.  Enter a cold room. Accept a white blanket. Use the same vein. Turn off the lights.\n4.  Take a flash photo. Send it to your mother.\n5.  Feel close to God for an hour. Understand. It’s all so simple. Simple, but still.\na. Bailey tells me sex on ketamine is supposed to be really intense. He knows exes that fell back in love after it. I tell him, that makes sense. On ketamine I’m in love with everyone.\n6.  Drink water from a paper cup. Walk back to the restroom. Pee. Still coming down. Take a flash photo in the mirror. Attach yourself to reality. Send it to your mother.\n7.  Depart.\na. Go shopping. See a bunny. Name it Context.\nb. Get lost. Go home.\n8.  In bed. Pour over hundreds of screenshots.\na. Laugh. Then cry. And sleep.\nb. Wake up wanting.\nAccording to an arbitrary rating system after each session, I am 11% better. I clap a gnat to death. A big boom for a minuscule thing. The acupuncturist loses a needle in me. The Uber has fake grass for a floor. He wishes me good luck in all my beginnings. But it’s my ends that need the wishing. It’s that quarter of my soul, stolen by a cokehead highschooler in 2010. Three quarters of a wish.\nAbby Romine\nis a sentimental poet from the San Fernando Valley. Her work is marked by melodrama, irrelevant humor, and premature greys. You can find her in your phone publicly\n@cyb3rf33lings\nor privately\n@abbyromine\n. While physically based in Brooklyn, she's just another girl online to you: abstract, waiting for meaning.",

    "title": "MISSING",
    "text": "ad of myself staring back with my expiration date stamped across my forehead, but 10 years younger. Like those pictures on milk cartons.\nI stare at my reflection like watching bird shit dry on a windshield.\nThey say everything has an expiration date. Who tf knows if that’s true.\nOne can only hope we’re so lucky.\nDon’t know why but it feels like I should mention Tuna is more of a step-cat. Bbyangel had her when we started dating, and they were a package deal. When she moved in, it was just something I had to accept. Newton’s Third Law type beat.\nI accepted Tuna the same way Bbyangel makes me eat veggies when she makes me\nalgo rico\n. I kept making jokes about how I was gonna put her in the\ncalle\n. How I’d find a way to get rid of her. That she’d just disappear one day. I wouldn’t actually do it obvi. But it’s the only way I know how to flirt. Autism is my love language.\nThe thing I didn’t account for is growing so fond of the cat. That I’d even start loving it and would be the one getting in trouble for spoiling it. Even spoiling it to be passive aggressive and piss Bbyangel off occasionally. Love is a proxy war.\nI guess my point is this only makes the ordeal all the more fucked up.\nJealous of our child on some Oedipal\nish\n.\nI need something to quiet the thoughts. Something to abate them at least. I sit on the couch with this dour demeanor you’d expect to see at a funeral.\nSin distracciones\n, I’ll end up sitting like that for hours. Staring at the food with that same dead-eyed stare cats and dogs have when they’re shitting or peeing. Avoiding eye contact. Self-awareness rendered a byproduct of vulnerability. Reduced to a survival mechanism engrained in your instincts. Sometimes it feels like the only time I’m self-aware is when the world is plotting to snuff me out. Tho my paranoid, pot-addled, and undeveloped mind used to think it was the other way around. Bbyangel says when my brain gets obsessive and intractable, I should find a way to distract myself.\n‘What do you think getting faded was?’ I want to say when she administers thrifted therapy.\nDistracciones son mi idioma de amor\n. Instead, I only ever nod and mumble in agreement. Never really say what I want to say. Love is a splitting atom; it’s being in dissonance. I go to the fridge like I could just will food into existence but open it and stare inside like opening a check at a restaurant you already know you can’t afford.\nI should be working because I’m already behind. Usually when I feel like this, I scroll through my phone. Itinerantly bouncing from app to app like a nomad. Beat my meat every few hours until cumming feels like ripping a fart. But those impulses have been supplanted by this other thing. That bowl of food that Tuna visits intermittently. I don’t really mean to start watching it, but it just happens. Sounds like a cop out, but I don’t know how else to describe it. I end up watching commercials for cat food.\nWhich feels even more humiliating to admit than watching furry porn involving two people dressed as cats. I scroll through a few before I find the one I like. The one I literally watch on a loop to sate my hunger like an alcoholic watching\nLeaving Las Vegas\nto drink vicariously. Symbiotically. It doesn’t exactly make that desire subside, but it at least keeps me from getting a taste. Delays the inevitable.\nThe one I watch goes like this:\nIt starts with two cats. Airbrushed, photo-shopped, and everything as if they were insecure about how they’d appear on camera. Like, if a camera adds 10 lbs, imagine what it feels like when you barely weight 12 lbs to begin with. One even has abs.\nThey walk through a giant gate reminiscent of the proverbial ‘pearly gates,’\nFor the record, if heaven exists, I hope this is it.\nThey slowly enter, looking around in awe with a golden sidewalk beneath them and a giant Ferris Wheel in the background. The sky is a deep blood red, and the clouds look like purple cotton candy. It’s like a Willy Wonka Factory I’d actually want to visit.\n‘It really exists. It’s Crispy’s World!’ Cat 1 says in awe, an orange and white specimen of a feline. Legit the mfing Myles Garret or Nick Bosa of cats.\n‘Look at the choices!’ Cat 2 adds, a black and white cat with a gravelly voice.\n‘No way—extra gravy!’ Cat 1 says, motioning with a nod to a giant volcano in the distance spouting gravy flowing like spittle down a baby’s chin.\nCat 1 hits a lever. They ride in two carts that are giant tins of cat food, looking around and traveling down a river of milk. ‘\n‘Look at the little soups!’\n‘And there’s the shreds of meat!’\n‘Man, Crispie’s has it all—can I have it all? Pleaaassseee?’\nThe camera pans out to them eating a sumptuous feast of different bowls on a table, and it pans out further to show a sign erected along the gate that looks like a marquis and reads: Crispie’s Treats: Let Them Feast. A girl-ish woman’s voice reads it while another voice sings ♪ Crispie’s ♫ in a jingle after.\nI watch it for hours on repeat. Hypnotized. I don’t even realize how much time passes. I start imagining it’s a real place. It becomes my\nEl Dorado\nor\nAtlantis\n. Like, imagine the spoils I would enjoy after that expedition. Before I know it, it’s time for Bbyangel to get home.\nFuck\n. I still haven’t gotten work done. But there’s always tomorrow. A new day means new excuses.\nOne day at a time. This, this is the way.\nI wait until Bbyangel comes back to eat. I have no choice. Try convincing myself it’s fasting, but it’s more like convincing myself a litter box is a beach. Lol.\nI look at myself in the mirror and say, ‘\nCope harder bro\n.’\nAll I can think about is the cat food. I sit with a face like a rubber dollar-store mask staring at it. Eyes, burned out headlights in my skull. Flat, glossy, and ineffectual. I try to get work done, and manage to get through some things, but still fall further behind. I gotta get it together. But I can’t mfing concentrate now that I got a whiff of it.\nTrying to push that hunger out of my mind is like trying to choke out a crash test dummy. I smelled that fistful of cat food pellets and it was like a sommelier smelling a glass of vino with the smarmy demeanor and intonation of a snake-oil salesman. Talking about the notes and undertones and all that shit and it sounding more like they were clairvoyant corresponding with the dead. I convince myself I can smell the beef, chicken, and veggies. Convince myself the chicken is free range, too. So I feel less shitty over this hunger. Like,\nat least it’s ethically sourced\n.\nWould cannibalized hippy vegans be free-range and ethically sourced, too?\nThese are the tangents I let myself follow to distract myself from the hunger.\nBbyangel gets home and brings supplies for\ntortas\n.\nBolillos y carne asada\n. I sit on the couch with all the charm of a scarecrow while she cooks. Suck at a cigarette. Scroll through my phone while\nScarface\nplays muted on the TV. The scene where he drinks the water they bring him in Bolivia to wash his hands with. Eats the oranges in it and everything. Right before they hang that dude from the helicopter. Always fucking kills me. Even the smell of cooking meat can’t rout the incomparable smell of the cat food from my nose. It’s impregnable in my nostrils. I wish my senses would make sense.\n‘Are you OK?’ Bbyangel asks.\n‘Yeah, why?’\n‘You’ve looked weird these days.’\n‘Just tired.’\n‘Hm. OK.’\n‘What?’\n‘\nNo te creo, pero si lo dices\n.’\nShit. Never thought I’d have to worry about me snitching on myself.\nIt’s always the people you most expect. Stg.\nI go to the tiendita while she’s cooking. Busting a mission to get more water,\nfrijoles\n, and\naguacate\n. Can’t drink water out of the tap here, and I go through about three liters of\nPeñafiel\na day. Used to go all the way to Oxxo before I knew this tiendita took card. Just assumed they didn’t. A completely baseless assumption, too, tbh.\nThe tiendita’s right around the corner. A three-minute walk.\nPass the Chinese-themed bar. The new\nFresa\nhipster spot. Hit or miss on whether it’s full. When it’s not, it’s just loud music playing to an empty beer garden and the most depressing thing you’ve ever laid eyes on. Pass the giant near-condemned house I love that Bbyangel is convinced is a\nnarco\nsafe house. Pass the house that always has a security guard posted up outside. Like, 24/7. Means someone important lives there. Bbyangel says it must be a\nnarco\n. Says the safehouse must be for whatever narco lives there. Same security guard who greets Bbyangel with a, ‘\nBuenos noches\n,’ every time she passes but only ever eyes at me like I’m scheming to lick that mfing house. Shouldn’t bother me as much as it does. Passed where the\nperrito\nyaps and attacks me. Gets out and starts nipping at my ankles. Bbyangel would probably say that mutt has\nnarco\nties, too.\nThe tiendita is one long narrow aisle. There’s a freezer with ice cream jutting out like a barricade that bisects it so you have to walk out and around to the second door when there’s a line. Cooler with tortillas. Loosie cigarettes for sale.\nCaguamas\n.\nMisma mierda,\ndifferente tiendita\n. Stomach’s growling like\nbarrio\ndogs looking for scraps. I browse the store and look at the\npapitas\nand other junk food. There is no one else inside. Guy behind the register plays Mexican rap music on tinny phone speakers. I grab water, beans, avocado, and go to get a roll of toilet paper. On the way, I see pet food.\nI see the cat food in my periphery and just stand there and stare. Transfixed. Captivates me in a way nothing else in this store does. Must be what Tuna experiences when we play sounds of cats meowing to fuck with her. To make her start going crazy. Like a psyop or MK-Ultra experiment. Scrambling her brain for shits and giggles. I look at the cat food and imagine it with\nchamoy\nand\nValentina’s\n.\nA little\nlimon\nfor good measure.\nFuck it, might as well make it like\ntostilocos\n.\nI stand there so long my mouth starts watering. My eyes glaze over. I go full Smeagol staring at the cat food. Look at the different flavors.\nPescado. Pollo. Atun. Res.\nI start wondering how they taste. See the fancy, wet food and the dry kibble, and wonder what it’s like to indulge in the former. How much better it must taste. Seems more decadent. Comfort food for cats. I snap out of it eventually and glance at the guy working the register. He looks at me like I’m out my box.\nI go over, pay, and leave. Light a cigarette as soon as I step outside. Need to calm my nerves. Can’t stop thinking about the food. The menu of options. Decide to check the flavor of what we have later. Bbyangel gives me the same spiel when I get back. Tells me I should work on myself. Talks about bettering myself.\nI agree but keep it noncommittal. Because my feet stay cold, bro. Like Antonio Brown’s. Iykyk. I tell her I’ll see what I can do to put a few of her recommendations into practice. See if it makes a difference. Baby steps. I even believe I will for a minute even though we both know I won’t. She insists on therapy, and I hit her with a strong,\nTal vez\n.\n‘Baby,’ she says as she’s finishing the tortas, ‘You know you talk in your sleep? You’ve been saying a lot of stuff the last few nights.’\nHijo de puta\n. I worry I spilled the\nfrijoles\non myself. Feels less like spilling the beans and more like a gas leak.\n‘What do I say?’ is all I think to ask. Heart races. Stomach torques.\n‘You keep asking,\nIs this bad ass?\nYou ask it over and over and over.’\nLol. On brand, bro. We both laugh, and I feel something like relief.\nI manage to stomach the food and eat until I can’t move and then lay on the couch like a blanket draped over it. I eat like a semi-sentient garbage disposal. Think of the cat food the whole time. I wait until Bbyangel’s asleep, which means Tuna’s asleep. So the coast is clear. I even pretend talking in my sleep so she thinks I’m asleep and goes to sleep.\nYeah, I know.\nIt’s a whole thing\n.\nWhen I’m convinced I’m the only one awake, I get up as quietly as possible and avoid sudden movements. I get on my hands and knees and slowly crawl to the food. I glance over my shoulder, and Tuna’s woken up. I see her big eyes staring at me like two curious searchlights. Hope she doesn’t move. Raise my index finger to my lips like,\nshhh\n. She actually listens for once. I inch closer and closer to her food bowl. When I get to it, I grab one of the pebbles and look at it like an artifact. Like it was something precious. Like treasure I found. Hold it to my nose again and basically get high off it. Was absolutely stuffed before smelling it, but I’m famished afterward.\nFuck\n. Look back, and Tuna’s still staring at me like I was an animal in the zoo. I look at the pebble for a few minutes, pop it in my mouth like a painkiller, and chew. It’s harder than I expected, but it tastes like nothing I’ve had before.\nIt’s like chewing on a rock at first. I can’t help but think of that\nStrange Addictions\nepisode about the woman who’s addicted to eating rocks. Like, Bro,\nI finally get it\n. Only thing I can liken it to is when someone finds religion late in life and sees the light. When they have that moment of clarity that saves their soul. I put another in my mouth, then another, and I try deducing the flavor like wine tasting. Roll them around with my tongue. After deliberation, I land on chicken.\nI decide I’ll check to see if I’m right the next day.\nIt feels like I’m going to wake up with purpose. That I have a mission, something akin to a crusade. Can’t tell you the last time I went to bed feeling like the next day wouldn’t amount to little more than a stamped out cigarette butt you scrape off the sidewalk or dredge out of an ashtray and get a few drags out of praying to God it’s not\nmenthol\n. After eating that food, I go to bed more sated than I’ve been in years. Normally, I’d stare at my phone screen into the early hours or morning, wake up feeling like shit, and suffer through the day. But I don’t even feel the need to do that tonight.\nThat compulsion is attenuated.\nI simply am, and that’s finally enough.\nMy name is\nJosh Rodriguez\n, and I'm a writer living in Tijuana, Mexico, with my girlfriend.

    "text": "My dream dinner party guest is a clementine spotted sunfish.\nI’d wear a candy red dress right up to top thigh, awfully vibrant in the riverbed, in the silty section of the shallows. We both arrive at eight. I dip in slow, reserved and bitchy as midwinter warm with only good intentions. I’ve got cinnamon stick legs, and grapefruit spit glistening lips perfect for an innocent well timed bloom, saying just the right thing with the right amount of breath. The fish watches me descend. He never blinks.\nIt’s good to see you.\nThe table’s all set with rose colored radicchio, dark wine stain skinned plums, and green beans in lavish garlic lying lazily round baby blue candlesticks with honey white flames that flicker in river tempo. In jade vases squirm coontails, hydrilla and water hyacinth. There’s green grapes, pears, mandarins and miniscule crustaceans, little invertebrates delicate as desire all ivory and gold lounging sideways in the algae with their hips tilted up. I’ll tilt my hips too.\nThe sunfish brazen sips from my martini glass and leans forward to feel my cold human hands which he holds on to for too long. I blush twenty shades of snapdragon. He’s lovely. He’s turquoise and tomato red, juicy vesicles from mythological citrus. His tongue is toothless, with a mouth position deemed\nterminal\nin encyclopedias. I did my research beforehand. He knows. He can tell how I feel by my darkening indigo eyes. In response, he performs powerful sweeping motions with his caudal fin. He’s a little fuckboy.\nI take full responsibility for this fantasy.\nRagtime piano plays.\nDuring dinner I'll explain my theory of moral change. You must assume full agency, avoid resentment at all costs. The fish will say he saw another ex lover the night before and she told him he’s like a character in a poorly reviewed film. I imagine her tits heavy, her dark hair parted over to one side. I’ll say that up on dry land I no longer speak to women, only boys in big pants who dance to Black Eyed Peas on a Sunday afternoon in an empty bar with no concern for wealth. The fish asks what I really value. I say,\nFreedom\n. The fish will say their father is an asshole which we knew beforehand. He lives out west in a childhood home, fully regressed egg state. I lower my chin in coy sympathy. In this way, we will participate in confession in a less than catholic sense.\nThe meal moves on into spiced ginger, smeared butter lemon slice tinged teeth and empty shells set aside for minimal home decor later on. There’s cola, figs, and parsley dipped in tears like at a messianic passover dinner in a southern baptist home then the music shifts into easy harp like a grecian dream when I place my fingernails on my lips while he messes up his hair. Our cadence slows. Here in the cobalt we sit quietly, the sunfish and I, lapping up the lusciousness. It's a delight to hold my breath this long. It's orgasmic.\nI’ll explain my hope to one day live fulltime in bad water, the brackish kind that’s salty enough to scrape these salacious perl barnacles off my flesh. There’s a virtue to saying no, certainly, a virtue like a spotted throbbed banana peel sitting on a windowsill waiting to be made into bread.\nI’ve got to get better.\nThen the fish might look at me, with lust in his eyes and ask\nso what are we doing?\nI’ll lean forward to say,\nI don’t care, I’m so full of joy.\nI’m flickering, quivering and the fish feels it against his pointed pectoral fin. We return to the concept of agency, nightmares, and grasshoppers dancing round on from sharp hooks floating too and fro. At the end of dinner the fish might finish off my last cigarette and say\nyou shouldn’t see me again.\nWhen I protest the fish might say\nI want you so fucking much. Get out of my fucking car.\nI sit spread open on the riverbank, white takeout box in hand. I’m soaking wet honey. I’m dripping down the soaked crimson fabric fingering my nipples and seeping into the mossy soft of the land that stands between the fish’s home and the county road. I’m humiliated. I’ll never love again. Instead I’ll wring out my hair until it's white as the sun, I’ll grow my metallic nails longer, decorate my ears with medium sized dry jewels. The river water scent will nestle into my lungs until I’m something else than human. I’m a bivalve shellfish, zebra striped like a whore in 2002 and I halt the means of production with my stubbornness. I stay and stay and stay.\nWhile I wait, I eat maraschino cherries straight out of the jar. I think of future dinners with salamanders, bass, and horned toads. I slice open kiwis I never really wanted to consume. Besides, I don’t have a spoon. I’ll toss some of these sweetnesses back down in the river. There, enjoy.\nI read on a website orange spotted sunfish have a high tolerance for the opaque. They like low gradients, gravel, warm water and cottonwood roots. They also like soda water, strawberry flavored vape pens, self help books and blondes. Moreover, they are very good at explaining their moral failures. From the shallows of the Brazos they text\nI care about you so much.\nIt doesn’t matter, really. It was just a get to know you kinda question.\nGod, it's so silty. It’s liquid coal velvet slipping down my neck.\nThere,\nthe fish had said,\ndream about that.\nSteven asks another icebreaker:\nWhat kind of music do you listen to?\nThis is not going to end well.\nJerusha Crone\nis a writer and visual artist from Central Texas currently residing in Brooklyn.

(i made that up but for all intents and purposes, let’s continue).\nwhen i was eight years old i got my first pet: a small orange goldfish. my sister wanted to name the fish something gay like “goldy” or “sparkles”, but i was the one who stole the fish out of the fat kid’s basket at pet smart so we both decided that i would get to name it.\nafter much thought and consideration, i decided to name our new pet after my favorite actor at the time: jason segel.\nwhen we got home, we put jason segel on a shelf in our room and watched him bang his head into the glass over\nand over\nand over again.\nmuch to my surprise, the fish didn’t like it when i poured diet coke in the tank to see if it would get him high.\nhe died shortly after.\ni was racked with guilt.\ni had killed jason segel.\npart two – zoology\nfor a large portion of my childhood i wanted to be a zoologist. to be clear, this was before I knew what being zoologist was but i had overheard a grocer at safeway say it one time (for some reason) and i liked the way it rolled off her tongue so i just kinda went with it.\nregardless of my “alleged” lack of knowledge about zoology,\ni’ve always felt a strange\ncosmic\nalmost holy connection to it.\nlike the bond between an old white man and the three hundred dollar dinghy parked in his driveway that hasn’t moved since 1976: i loved zoology, and i would never let my bitch wife helen take that away from me.\ni remember the first time i spelled the word correctly enough so that google could understand what my chubby, chicken greased eight year old fingers were trying to say:\n“zoology: the scientific study of the behavior, structure, physiology, classification, and distribution of animals.”\nhuh.\nthought there would be a little more flair.\nwhat’s with all the buzzkill words? physiology? what the hell? am i at school right now? this sucks.\ni pressed the text to speech button over\nover\nand over again.\nit never sounded right. i think i liked the way the grocery lady said it better. or maybe i just liked her.\npart three – prelude\nthree years ago i got a plus one invite to the popular kid’s trip to the zoo. i went cuz i was bored and it was tuesday and what else was i gonna do, go to class? in college? yeah, right, don’t make me laugh.\ni didn’t know anyone except my friend, tara. tara was kind of a bitch and miserable and a horrible person to be around but she bought me edibles so we were chill i guess.\nbefore we walked in the gates, tara grabbed me by the shoulders and told me, “have fun”. i looked at her, “okay?”.\nshe grabbed my shoulders tighter and touched our noses together. i could smell her essence juicy bomb lipgloss. she wore the same peach flavor ever since 8th grade when a man on the street told her she had DSL. i don’t know why she did that.\nshe told me again, “have fun? okay?”. it was at that moment when i realized there was probably a reason why the heart-shaped cherry gummies i ate on the way over tasted like shit. I should have known.\ni hate you, tara. i hate you, tara. kiss me, tara. while our noses are still close. while no one is watching.\nmy head’s getting hot. fuck. i wonder what’s going on in econ.\npart four - the zoo\nit hit me while i was in the reptile exhibit. everything was chill until one of the garter snakes started cussing me out so i had to get the fuck out of there.\nnext stop was the red pandas.\nas i sat down on a cold bench watching a bunch of preteens take selfies with the red pandas i couldn’t help but notice the small, gray spotted pigeon perched on the trashcan next to me.\nfor those of you who are unfamiliar - the plight of the standard american homing pigeon is, canonically, very sad.\nin world war I and world war II homing pigeons were bred as agents of war, taking covert pictures and sending secret messages across enemy lines.\nthey were smart - capable - the only birds up to the task.\nunfortunately, after world war II, there was no more use for them so the united states government released tens of thousands of highly trained war veteran pigeons into the public to live on their own.\nand now, as i sat on a cold bench next to preteens filming tiktoks with red pandas, i watched as a former member of the u.s. military picked sixteen dollar lightly salted popcorn out of a trash can.\ni almost started to cry.\nnot only was this veteran severely deprived of his rights after active duty, he was the only animal in the entire zoo that didn’t have a name.\nif i stood up and walked ten feet in any direction i could learn the name, age, height, species, favorite food and celebrity crush of animals from across the globe.\nanimals that i don’t see in my backyard.\nanimals that i might never see again in my whole life.\nand yet, here sits my neighbor.\na pigeon.\nnameless, homeless, aimless.\ni wanted to cry.\ni wanted to ask him his name. i wanted to ask if he’s really from new york or new jersey like i imagine all pigeons are for some reason.\ni wanted to ask him if he likes sesame bagels.\nif he takes long walks in the park when he’s feeling sad.\nif he has kids, grandkids, friends, enemies.\ni wanted to ask him if he’s been to the statue of liberty.\nwhat the views are like from a hundred feet above.\nif we look small from so far away.\nif he can even see us at all.\nbut i didn’t ask him any questions because out of the corner of my eye i could see tara smiling at the red pandas. i could tell she thought she was alone because she never smiled. i liked it when she did.\ni looked back at the pigeon. i cried. i wonder what stories lay beneath those beady little soldier eyes.\ni took a step closer but i guess my sudden movement must have spooked him because the second i moved, his legs were already three feet off the ground. i watched as it flew away.\ni looked at a red panda.\ni looked at the preteens - seems like their tik tok came out well.\ni looked at the red panda again.\nher name was lala. she was four years old. her mom was from china but lala was born at the zoo. i smiled at her. i’m not sure if there was a glare in the glass but she didn’t smile back.\ni looked up at the pigeon, now a small dot in the endless sky.\ni swear i saw him wave.\ncharlotte loesch\nis a virginia-born screenwriter & poetess who recently earned her BFA in keepin’ it real. she loves diet coke, swimming in large bodies of water, and frustrating her conservative family members. you can follow her\n@charlo1320\non insta and substack.",

    "text": "Just scrolling through my timeline and finding excuses not to work. Sitting on the couch. Ordering coffee to be delivered. Start feeling hungry. Famished. Instincts start holding me hostage. Spend hours browsing Uber Eats,\nDidi\n, and\nRappi\n. Iykyk. Never buying anything. Just imagining what it’d be like to eat. Try conjuring counterfeit satiation. Browse them with all the dignity of a cheater browsing sordid subreddits and classified ads and swiping through dating apps to get off. Sexting with people but never following through and, like, fucking them, so they rationalize and justify the behavior. Convincing themselves it’s not cheating because there was no skin-to-skin contact.\nAbsolving themselves on a technicality, bro.\nLike a quarterback lobbying for a ref to pick up a flag.\nTrying to exploit some kind of loophole.\nI look at Tuna hunched over her bowl of food. Tiny brown pellets. Almost looks like chips. I’ve always been more of a salty and savory kinda guy than a sweet and soft-baked one. I start getting jealous. My stomach starts growling. Can’t leave too much food out for her either. She apparently has a similar issue with over-indulging. But she still has food to munch on. Spoiled ass cat, bro. She even has health insurance.\nI don’t even have health insurance\n. Can’t help but wonder what that food tastes like.\nShe can’t get enough of it. So good she doesn’t even look up when she eats it. Must slap. I know she eats bugs, so her palate isn’t exactly refined, but I can’t imagine the shit I eat is much better. Protein’s protein, bro. Every time I start making progress on my work, I catch myself looking at it. Get distracted. Entranced. Like it’s beckoning me. Temptation. Like a parallel universe where the forbidden fruit was hanging off a cat tree. It gets so my mouth waters when I look at that bowl of food. It’s all I can think about. I go to the fridge and look inside to distract myself, less like I was hoping it would magically have food and more like I was hoping for that Indiana Jones scene where they open the\nArk of the Covenant\nand their faces melt off their skulls like nacho cheese.\nI open the fridge hoping it’ll obliterate me. But I’ve never been lucky.\nI have to take a cold shower to snap out of it. And even that only helps a little.\nBecause I bet that shit’s\nsavory\n, too.\nThat night, Bbyangel comes home, and I greet her with the same excitement a dog greets their owner with. It’s pavlovian. I hear the big, steel door outside click open like a reinforced door in prison. I know I’m about to eat. Mouth waters and ears start ringing.\nTuna has the same reaction. I can tell Bbyangel thinks it’s weird I bombard her with that energy upon her arrival. Definitely unusual. Borderline sus. But she doesn’t say anything. Just looks at me like I’m a homeless person asking for money. Can’t help but feel indignant. Like,\nWhat—it’s OK if Tuna does it, but if I do it, I’m bugging?\n‘\nHola, baby\n,’ I say, ‘\nComo estuve trabajo?\n’\n‘\nBien\n,’ she says, ‘\nTuve un chingo de citas. Estoy cansada.\n’\nShe knows what I’m pussyfooting around. She wastes no time retrieving food she bought at the carniceria on her way home. Rice, beans, chicken, and corn tortillas. The smell fills the room, and I get a contact high. Like she was hot boxing the apartment and I wasn’t in the mood to smoke but got zooted nonetheless. Like,\nOK—OK, if you’re gonna twist my arm like the tip of that joint…\nI sit on the couch and try to distract myself with my phone. Tuna climbs into my lap. I look at Tuna’s\ncarrita bonita\nand rub her under her chin like she likes with my forefinger. She goes full\nchinita con sus ojitos\nand I realize in that moment that I could never stay mad at her. I smell the food Bbyangel’s making and look at her.\nAs fucked up as it sounds, I don’t know if I’ve ever loved her as much as I do rn. All that other shit I was feeling almost melts away in that moment. But I still find myself looking at Tuna’s bowl. Eyes gravitate to it like when there’s an imperfection that constantly draws your gaze.\nLike when your friends point out a flaw in your significant other and it’s all you can notice, making you hit Seinfeld levels of psychopathy that’s pure tragedy without the laugh track. Laughter’s mostly a coping mechanism. It has diminishing returns as you develop a tolerance. But I’ve learned pushing all your friends away until you don’t have any is a life hack that helps with that. Because some friends will go full\nTaken\nand try to extricate you from any romantic arrangement. Whether it’s well-intentioned or not.\nI look at the bowl. Tuna left me leftovers. The pellets of food entice me somehow. My mouth waters. I swallow saliva. Choke on it like a hairball and try to play it off.\nBbyangel asks, ‘\nPuedes limpiar la mesa y arreglar tus cosas?\n’\n‘\nSi, baby\n,’ I oblige.\nWe sit down and eat, and it’s good. I stuff food down my throat like a dirty sock in a hostage’s mouth to stifle blood-curdling screaming. To stymy the whimpering and muffle the crying. Like I’m holding myself hostage. I eat eight tacos in an hour and hope it’ll temper my brain. But I can’t stop thinking about Tuna’s food. My brain orbits it like a planet orbiting the sun. I can’t sleep because it’s all I think about. Technically it’s food left out, and Bbyangel said we have to finish it all. Technically, bro.\nTechnically…\nLove is fashioning nooses out of loopholes.\nThe next day, I kiss Bbyangel goodbye. She leaves out a plate of breakfast for me like leaving out food for a dog. My stomach still feels funky from eating as much as I did. I’m exhausted. Obsessed over Tuna’s food all night. Barely slept a wink.\nTell Bbyangel I’m exhausted when I wake up, too. When she asks why I couldn’t sleep, I can’t bring myself to say the reason. Realize I have no good reason to offer so I shouldn’t have said anything. Tell her I just couldn’t is all. Look at her like,\nJust drop it, OK?\nThere’s something ignoble about it. Like some debased fetish that triggers the Catholic guilt baked into the fibers of your conscience and makes you hate yourself.\nSelf-hate is my love language.\nI get an email from a client asking for an update on two deliverables. An article and a newsletter. I was supposed to get them done yesterday, but I was too distracted. Tell them it’s on my list of to-dos today and make up some bullshit excuse. I resolve to be productive. Take an inventory of top-priority tasks. Feel some kind of fortitude, like I’m gonna buckle down and get to work. Get my shit together and put my nose to the grindstone. But\nfuck\n. All I think about is that food.\nMy stomach doesn’t growl, it\npurrs\n.\nTuna hunches over her bowl like she’s mocking me. I hear her eating and it sounds like someone walking across gravel. I go to the fridge and look inside like I was hoping food would magically appear. That it’d manifest like a water stain of the\nVirgen Maria\nor\nVirgen Fatima\nor\nVirgen de Guadalupe\nor some shit. It seems like all I hear about in Mexico are virgins, but I haven’t met one since I’ve been here. I don’t know what I expected to find, but I can’t help feeling disappointed by the empty fridge.\nStart feeling like I’d settle for spoiled, mold-bearded food at this point.\nI guzzle\nPeñafiel\n. Order coffee. Try to work. But my brain keeps returning to that bowl of food. And I don’t know what comes over me, but I eventually snap. Can’t take it anymore. I wait until Tuna is taking one of her daily naps on our bed (must be nice), get down on all fours, and crawl to the food bowl with all the trepidation of traversing a minefield. I inch closer and closer, and my body trembles.\nWhen I’m close enough to smell it, I freeze. The closer I get, the more I feel it crush me like an empty beer can beneath a boot. Turns my ass 2-D. The pressure mounting like each inch closer was a fathom deeper in the ocean. Nearly go catatonic before finally parallel parking my ass next to that mf.\nStare into the bowl. Still as a mannequin. Brain, swelling with the kinda feedback you get when you hold a microphone too close to a PA system.\nI scoop out a handful of the food like scooping out kitty litter, and I hold it like treasure I just uncovered. I sit like that for maybe five minutes, practically prostrating myself. Supplicant. It’s the closest I’ve come to praying since I can remember. I bury my face in it and take a big whiff like perverts who order used panties online.\nAnd,\nbro\n—that shit\nhits\n. I start seeing spots, go lightheaded, and can barely bring myself to my senses. Have to drag myself back to them like taking a pet to the vet. I start reeling for a minute while I eventually manage to reorient myself. I dump the food back in. It takes every ounce of self-control I have not to stuff it in my mouth. I look over at Tuna, who’s staring at me with judgmental marble eyes. Can’t get read on her. Feel like she’s gonna rat or sth. You are what you eat fr fr.\nNever trusted her tbh. So I mad dog the\ngatito\n.\nI stare at her like, ‘\nQue, cabrona? Callate tu hocico. No haras nada, morra\n.’\nI keep dreaming that I look in the mirror and see a grainy black and white",

    "text": "Fame was the disease she wanted to catch. How she hoped her brief exposure was enough to make it terminal....\nWhen she was cast in\nThe Slain\n, no one believed it would become an overnight sensation. But when it did, her agent insisted that though she was merely a guest star—featured in only one episode—the show had accrued such a cult following, it would be worthwhile for her to get a publicist.\nAll the top firms were desperate to get their hands on her. Ana’s arc on the show was juicy and tragic—and she looked\nhot\n, even on her deathbed.\n“We see this catapulting you into the fashion world.”\n“Oh, I’m not a model. Just an actress.”\n“Precisely. We’ll get you in Dior or Dolce for the Emmy’s.”\n“The Emmy’s?”\n“\nThe Slain\nwill be nominated for\nsomething\n, surely.”\n“But I was just a guest star. I don’t think I get to go.”\n“You can buy a ticket. We just need pictures of you on the carpet, and we can get you to Paris in no time.”\n“To Paris?”\n“You’ll sit front row.”\n“Will that help me book another role?”\n“Of course. This is how it’s done.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“We are selling\nyou\n,” the fancy publicist had explained. Though what she left unsaid, was the fact that she was actually selling\nherself\nto Ana. Her services would run five-thousand dollars a month for at least three months, which was nearly five times more expensive than Ana’s rent-controlled apartment.\nHer team insisted this was worth the investment, so she went along with it. She signed the contract, and then quickly was told the next step was to set-up a photo shoot.\n“Don’t the magazines do that?” Ana asked.\nThe publicist laughed. “Sure, sometimes. If the story’s big enough. But for now, we need photos.”\nAna agreed to the photo shoot, despite the fact that her savings would be wiped out completely by the cost of the publicist alone. Now she had to figure in another two-hundred for hair, two-hundred for makeup, five-hundred for styling—the photographer agreed to comp their fee for the exposure—but there was still a one hundred and fifty dollar studio cost. As if that wasn’t enough, her publicist scheduled it during working hours.\nHer guest starring role on\nThe Slain\nhad paid her the equivalent of three months rent, but not enough to allow her to quit her day job: working the counter at a matcha shop. She couldn’t really, technically afford to take any more time off. But she needed to capitalize on this momentum, so she shrugged off the well of anxiety bubbling beneath her skin. How she craved to be a person people\ncared\nabout. If she could just become cool enough, maybe she could finally secure stable work as an actress! So what if she didn’t have money to spare on luxuries like gasoline and coffee? So what if she’d have to start walking three miles to and from work since the bus was too expensive? So what if her matcha shop manager started cutting her shifts since she’d become so unreliable a worker due to the press events clogging up her emails—luncheons, talks, interviews, galas, gifting suites, and branded experiences. She said yes to everything her team recommended. Even if each event with a carpet cost her another two-hundred for hair, two-hundred for make-up, five-hundred for styling—\n“Those are favor rates. When it’s out-of-pocket. Eventually, you’ll get a budget and\nThe Slain\n, or whoever, will pay them directly.”\n“You know I died in the show? I’m not going to be in the next season?”\nHer publicist’s face flickered with fear and frustration, “Of course I know that.”\nAna trusted her team implicitly. Their financial success was tied to her own. Right?\nThe photo shoot went off splendidly. The make-up artist spent two hours making Ana look blemish and make-up free, despite weighing her down with pounds of powder and cream. The hair stylist smoothed her wavy locks. The stylist placed her in beautiful fabrics with decadent gems and jewels to boot. Her publicist held the fan as the photographer shot her stills.\nThey all ooh-ed and ahh-ed at the beauty they had all collectively created and placed onto her.\nThis\nwas the becoming of a shiny, famous person. That’s what they promised her.\nFor the first time, Ana understood that anyone could become celebrity-beautiful with enough time, money, and attention.\nOnce the photos were locked, her publicist went into attack mode. Interviews, screenings, premieres, and more luncheons.\nAna barely saw the inside of the matcha shop. Only on her rare days off from her campaign for stardom, did she manage to wrangle a shift. With no money coming in, she began to panic.\nAna called up her agent and asked, “Is it helping?”\n“Oh, yes. Everyone’s asking about you.”\n“Then why haven’t I gotten any auditions?”\n“You’re offer only now.”\n“Am I getting any offers?”\n“No, but—”\n“Then why can’t I audition?”\nHer agent insisted it was better this way. Ana had to believe her.\nThough Ana was still on the far fringes of relevance—a blur in the background of a People image.... Once DeuxMoi featured as juicy goss that\na guest star from the hit show The Slain was working six days a week at a mediocre matcha spot\n, Ana’s publicist required she quit.\n“It’s not in alignment with your brand.”\n“Matcha?”\n“No. Working. In the service industry.”\n“Don’t most actors have day jobs?”\n“Maybe so, but they keep it hidden from the press. And me.”\n“So what should I do?”\nThe publicist’s smile tightened. “Well, I can’t tell you what to do. But as someone who has been working in this industry for over twenty years, I can just tell—it’s going to happen for you. It’s just a matter of timing and making sure nothing stands in between you and your dreams.”\nAna understood the subtext:\nquit your job. Start your career\n.\nSo, she quit her job and paid her rent, her publicist, her hair stylist, her make-up artist, and her stylist. She stopped driving her car so she wouldn’t need to refuel, and she started subsisting off her pantry staples, hoping to survive until her next offer.\nShe would sit by her phone, waiting for her next invitation. At the screenings, she got to enjoy the content she could no longer afford. At the luncheons, she got to feed herself—not tinned fish or instant ramen. At the premieres, she was able to try the hottest spots in town—which she would not forget to reference liberally in her many interviews. She was a woman about town, after all.\n“My favorite spot? Hm...probably Mother Kitchen, Per Favor Padre, or Vino & Timmy’s,” Ana said, wistfully.\nHer stylist eventually confronted her about her wardrobe. “You have no clothes. We need to go shopping. What’s your budget?”\n“I don’t...have one.”\n“Make one.”\nAna gulped. “I quit my job.”\nThe stylist’s face flooded with understanding, then said, “I have a plan,” and arranged for her to go to a showroom the following day.\n“What am I supposed to do at a showroom? Do I get to borrow the clothes?”\n“You get to shop. For free. Pick out pieces you can wear for carpets and interviews. Shop freely, but wisely,” the stylist instructed. “Take what you want, but be strategic.”\nAna accepted her mission.\nShe pawed through the rack, eyeing her prey. She wrote off a number of pieces as either too corporate or too\neasy\n. She narrowed her gaze on four items, and decided she’d need to limit what she grabbed to three. The cashmere would be coming home with her. But she couldn’t look too thirsty, too desperate for the free.\nShe pulled a skirt close to her body, and examined herself in the mirror. Her heart softened as she saw her image obey her commands. Her hair had behaved that morning, and for that, she was grateful. She looked the part: effortless, chic, like she was one to watch. She didn’t always look this way, and she knew it. She enjoyed dissociating and objectifying herself, imagining how the showroom associate saw her as she twisted her neck back to say, “Hmmm...I’ll take these, I think,” forcing her voice to sound disinterested, uncertain. Like she could afford not to take any of it.\n“So cute. Love. I’ll throw ‘em in your bag,” the associate said cheerfully. “We can look at the skincare options next.”\nAna smiled. Success. She wanted skincare. But she also wanted jeans. And a winter coat.\nAnd a piece of luggage, if they’d let her have it. She knew the old song and dance. The push and pull of this charade. How much could she take without making them question her.\n“Oh, I totally forgot. Did you say you wanted kombucha?” the associate asked upon her return.\n“That’s okay. Thanks.”\n“You sure?”\nAna nodded tightly. She had wanted kombucha. But today was about picking her battles. What she really wanted more than kombucha ($5.99), was a puffer coat ($189). What she needed, was a dress ($112 or $389—she must choose wisely). She was here on business, not as a shopper—but as a taker.\n“By the way, I\nloved\nyou in\nThe Slain\n. Your arc\nkilled\nme.”\n“Aw! Thanks. Yeah, it literally killed me!”\n“I was so bummed when you got—well—slain.”\nAna smiled tightly, “Nature of the beast.”\nThirty-seven minutes later, she left the showroom not a penny further in debt, with twenty-three items valued at one thousand two hundred and seventy-eight dollars. She faked nonchalance until she was safely back in the comfort of her 2014 Kia Soul she parked purposefully far away. She figured taking her old car was better than taking the bus.\nShe slammed the front door shut, and sighed. Thank god. She was in desperate need of a wardrobe refresh. This invitation had come just in the knick of time. Who could possibly turn down a free shopping spree? All it would cost her was a few social media mentions, her stylist assured her. She could afford to cheapen her Instagram in the name of free goods.\nJust as Ana began her most decadent drive back across town, her phone brightened with a notification. An email from her publicist. At a red light, she snuck a peak:\nAna,\nI have excellent news. We have secured you a ticket to The Emmy’s. The invoice is attached below. I’ll start working on a FYC push.\nYour stylist will be reaching out to set-up a fitting, and I will confirm HMU for the day. Will your base location be the same as usual, or would you like to reserve a hotel suite for the day?\nAna didn’t know what an FYC push was, but she knew it must be important. She would do whatever it took to allow herself that final push.\nUpon her return home, she scanned the web for easy ways to make money. She signed up to be considered for loads of clinical trials and focus groups. She applied for copywriting gigs despite being under-qualified. She created a Depop and listed all her used carpet clothing. She searched the web for un-sketchy petsitting and housesitting gigs, but somehow, instead of finding a lead, she wound up taking eighty-six surveys over the three hours that followed. She made $6.78. Big sigh.\nThe following day, her publicist explained all an “FYC push” entailed.\n“It’s no big, really. We’ll just continue on our track—getting you visibility. Placing you at the right events, and in conversation with the right people.”\n“Isn’t that what we’ve been doing already?”\n“Pretty much. All this means, officially, is that the network will add you to their materials. Mailers, press kits, you name it. They’ll pay the submission fee, which isn’t always a given. But they’re impressed with the buzz you’ve been generating. If they host a screening, you’ll be a panelist.”\n“With the main cast?”\n“Oh, yeah.”\n“That’s amazing!”\n“And we’ll continue on with our press push. But I’ll make sure everyone who talks to you is briefed that you’re under consideration for an Emmy. It’s more of the same, just a strategic way to make people associate your name with an award-worthy performance.”\nAna felt all the tension leave her body, she was at ease. Her lips curled into a smile.\n“But remember—don’t smile.”\n“Sorry,” Ana said, forcing her face to smize.\nAna did not get nominated for an Emmy. She didn’t even get mentioned by any of the websites that speculated about the possible surprise nominations. But she did get many more invitations and write-ups. Her agents praised her visibility, and set up general meetings for her with casting directors. Many of whom, she’d read for before—but none had previously viewed her as a real\ncontender\n.\nAna wasn’t quite sure what to talk about on these generals.\n“So, what are you working on now? Gearing up for season two?” One Casting Director asked.\nAna’s eyes unconsciously twitched. How to respond? “Yes,” she said, “very excited for it.” She was excited for it, even if she was neglecting to mention she had died on the show. Maybe there would be flashbacks? There wouldn’t, but clearly they hadn’t watched, so what did they know, anyway?\n“What was the process like?”\n“You mean the casting process, or filming?”\n“Casting.”\n“Well, my agents sent me the breakdown and I taped for it. They watched the tape, and honestly, there wasn’t even a meeting after that.”\n“They just saw you and knew.”\n“I guess.”\n“What’s\nyour\nprocess?”\n“Well, um, I guess I do some scene work. You know, read all the materials and mark up my script. I just think a lot, and then try to physicalize things. Does that make any sense?”\n“Totally.”\n“Sometimes I journal. Or coach if I can afford to.”\nThe Casting Director laughed, as if she were joking.\n“Oh, you’re being serious.”\n“No...?” Ana hedged.\n“God, you’re hilarious.\nAna smiled nervously, “thanks.”\n“So what do you want?”\n“I’m sorry?”\n“What do you want to do next?”\n“Oh, anything really. Something interesting, obviously, would be great. But, I just want to be on set. I want to be a working actor. Everyone’s trying to force me into fame, which is nice, because it makes working easier. But if I’m really honest with myself, I just want stable work.”\nThe Casting Director’s face fell. “You want...stable work?”\nAna realized her mistake. “I’m kidding!”\nThe Casting Director sighed, relieved. “Thank God.”\n“I wouldn’t have gone into entertainment if I wanted stability! No, um...I want passion. And roles that really, you know, call to me.”\n“And what roles call to you?”\n“Layered roles. Complicated ones. But also—flat roles, because then the job is harder, you know? To make the character come to life.”\n“I love that so much,” the Casting Director said, jotting down notes in Ana’s file. She hadn’t realized the Casting Director had been taking notes this whole time.\n“Do you always take notes in meetings?”\n“I do. A general with an actor is like an actor reading the full script. Do you know what I mean?”\nAna did not know what the Casting Director meant. But she was sure glad she met with her, because she’d sold nearly all the items she’d listed on Depop, and was only a few hundred dollars the richer. All that treasure would be wiped away the following day when it came time to pay her team to make her look perfectly naturally perfect for The Emmy’s. It would be nice to book another job.\nThat night, every celebrity would spend two hours\nminimum\nin the make-up chair before traversing the red. The mega famous may even pay their stylists to accompany them for the night, to erase their smudges and reapply what they hadn’t meant to erase. But the battle for the best artists and stylists meant that newbies like Ana had to get their glam on hours before they were due to walk.\n“It’s better to go early, anyway,” her publicist insisted.\n“Won’t it be awkward, just waiting around for everyone else to walk the carpet afterwards?”\nThe publicist stared back at Ana, unwilling to respond. Eventually, she deigned to speak on, “The car will come get you thirty minutes before the carpet opens. The drive shouldn’t take more than twenty minutes, but this gives you a buffer. I will meet you at the drop-off point, and we will line-up and be ready to walk the second they start clicking those cameras. Okay?”\n“Okay.”\n“Now, remember. This isn’t your average carpet. This isn’t some screening with one floating photographer, or even a premiere with a whole host of them and a few videographers to boot.”\nAna gulped.\n“This is the big leagues. This is a sea of red carpet. For as far as the eye can see: red carpet. Hundreds of photographers—all of whom will be begging you to\nlook here, look here, smile, turn around, give me a twirl, show off those shoes, look back at me, at me\n—and of course—\nsmile\n.”\nAna’s imagination ran wild. There she was, amidst the chaos, caught in the flashing light of this massive red carpet. Smile, they’d say. As she drowned in the flashing light—her life flashing before her eyes—frozen by pixels, captured on tiny screens.... She was at peace, and she was smiling.\n“Don’t smile. Whatever they say. Don’t listen. Don’t twirl. And definitely—do not smile.”\nAna’s face darkened.\n“Understood?”\nAna nodded.\n“Good. Once you complete the photos, there will be a host of interviews. We’ll do some of those, but many are on-air and only want big names. After that, there’s the three-sixty photo studio, which will secure an unbeatable pic of you in your dress. This is the only time you may twirl. Understood?”\n“Understood.”\n“You remember what we taught you about posing? Feet straight, arms close to the body, hands and mouth relaxed—always smizing.”\n“Of course.”\n“Good. Don’t forget. After the three-sixty, there may be a few photo booth set-ups. You can do those if you want. Then you’ll walk again once your costars arrive.”\n“My costars?”\n“From\nThe Slain\n.”\n“Am I allowed to walk with them?”\n“Are you\nallowed to walk with them\n?”\n“Don’t they only want photos of the main cast?”\n“Precisely. That’s why you’ll walk with them.”\nAna gulped, she felt her shoulders tense and her chest cave. She hated to take up space where she was not welcomed. But maybe things had changed since set. Maybe now that she was becoming\nsomebody\n, they would include her in their inside jokes.\n“You were up for your consideration!” Her publicist insisted.\n“But I wasn’t nominated. I was never going to be nominated. It was practically a joke.”\n“No, it wasn’t,” she said with such conviction, that for a moment, just a moment, Ana believed she had actually had a shot of getting nominated.\n“I was never going to get nominated.”\n“Of course not. That’s not why we put you up for consideration and you know it. We put you up for consideration—”\n“I thought\nthey\nput me up for consideration?”\n“Sure, but we encouraged it. We dared them not to.”\n“Okay....”\nThe publicist cleared her throat, then continued, “\nWe\nput you up for consideration so they would view you as\nessential\n. So they would recognize your talent and promote you from a guest star...to a\nstar\n. And that is why you must walk with them. Because now you are just like the rest of them. You are a star.”\nAnd just like that, Ana’s hair stylist and makeup artist were knocking on her door. They squeezed into her apartment and didn’t mention that their next stop would be an A-Lister staying at the Four Seasons or the Beverly Hilton—maybe the Ritz if they wanted to be downtown, close to the ceremony.\nThe stylist came promptly after, and hung the dress for all to see.\n“So what are we thinking for hair? Maybe up to keep the neckline clean?” The hairstylist asked.\n“Fine, but no braids. Simple and sleek,” the stylist instructed.\n“Simple and sleek,” the hairstylist repeated.\n“I love the slight shimmer. Maybe we do our usual no-makeup look, natural pink lip, and a hint of a golden-peach shimmer on the eye. Something subtle.”\n“If it’s subtle, I love it,” the stylist said.\n“That sounds great!” Ana said. Everyone smiled, and then they all got to work on their willing canvas.\nThe hair stylist straightened every last strand of Ana’s hair. The make-up artist cleansed her face, then primed it with hydrating serums and creams. She stuck eye masks on while she worked on the edges of her face. Next would come the litany of products designed to make Ana more beautiful. To make her into a star. All the while, the stylist examined shoe options and earring alternatives. And Ana sat there, still as a doll, never forgetting to smize—not smile.\n“Are you excited?” The stylist asked.\n“Nervous,” Ana admitted.\n“Why are you nervous?” The makeup artist inquired.\nAna shrugged, “First big carpet.”\nThe car came just when the publicist said it would. The makeup artist bronzed her legs and then the stylist gently shuffled Ana into the car, careful to ensure the dress would remain unwrinkled and photo-ready.\nHer chorus of beauticians exclaimed in unison: “You look stunning,” “This look is so freaking good. I’m deceased,” and “She’s a star!”\nAnd then the door slammed, and she was left alone—well, alone with her driver.\nTogether they sat in silence. He drove while Ana scrolled through socials. She perfunctorily took some videos and selfies, feeling a fool. Trying again and again to look effortless and cool and like she didn’t care at all.\nAna arrived at the carpet early. So early it was closed. She had a solid six minutes to adjust her dress, de-shrimp her toes, blot the oil from her face, and reapply lipstick. The little to-go pack her makeup artist had sent her away with had come in clutch—and fit in one, too.\nShe texted the contact from her PR company who would be walking her down the carpet as she watched the photographers shimmy into their places, fighting for prime locations. Publicists buzzed about, checking their lists were in order and nothing was amiss.\n“Ana! Hi, I’m Kristie,” the publicist said as she approached. She was so chipper Ana winced.\n“Hi!”\n“So, the carpet opens in just a few minutes. Wanna freshen up real quick and we can get you on before anyone else gets here? Your timing is perf.”\n“Really? It’s not too early,” Ana said as she looked around. Nobody was here. Nobody famous, at least.\n“No exactly, it’s perfect.”\nAna nodded, understanding. It was perfect. Nobody famous was here. This was her time.\nShe unclasped her clutch, blotted her forehead and nose, then reapplied her lipstick.\n“I’m ready whenever.”\n“Sweet. Let’s do this,” the publicist said as she opened her iPad and opened her Emmy’s PDF. She flipped past the recognizable names all the way to Ana’s—written clearly in big, bold Helvetica.\nShe stepped onto the carpet as her shoes straps dug into her ankle. She smiled automatically, but caught herself before the clicking began. She relaxed her mouth, and smized just in time for the cameras to come to life. Flash, flash, “over here,” “over here,” flash, flash, “look back,” flash, “smile,\" flash, \"show off the dress,” “give us a twirl,” flash, “who are you wearing?,” flash, flash, “over here,” “over here.”\nAll eyes were on Ana. Alone in a sea of red. Her face, a willing canvas for their light and perspective.\nShe took her time, as instructed: one camera at a time. Each flash filled her whole body with warmth. What could have felt overwhelming, instead felt peaceful and serene.\nOf course they were taking her photo, hungry to send the images off to the presses. It made sense they were all looking at her.\nFinally, she was exactly where she belonged\n, she thought, as she floated to the end of the carpet, high on all the eyes and attention.\nWhen she reached the end of the red-lined-road, she was whisked over to the interviewers.\n\"Who are you wearing?”\n“How long did it take you to get ready today?”\n“How do you feel about being here?”\n“Who are you wearing?”\n“How are you feeling about your chances at taking home the trophy?”\n“Who are you wearing?”\n“What are your favorite memories from filming The Slain?”\n“What’s in store for season 2?”\n“Who are you wearing?”\n“Who are you most excited to meet today?”\n“Who are you wearing?”\n“Who are you wearing?”\n“Who are you wearing?”\n“Who are you wearing?”\nWhen Ana reached the end, she was greeted by a pretty girl holding a tray of water bottles.\n“Why do they have straws instead of caps?” Ana asked.\nThe pretty girl smiled condescendingly, then replied, “For your makeup, of course.”\n“Of course,” Ana said, with a pang of remorse. How had she been so thick not to assume the straw was for her benefit.\n“Don’t worry. They’re paper straws. We would never use plastic.”\n“Obviously,” Ana said.\n“Obviously,” the pretty girl replied.\n“Are you ready?” The publicist asked.\n“For what?”\n“The carpet, of course.”\n“Of course.”\n“So you’re ready?”\n“Didn’t I just do it?”\n“Yes, but now your whole cast is here and waiting to walk.”\n“They’re waiting to walk?” Ana asked, her eyes skimming past the red to the start of the step and repeat. A line had formed.\n“Yes, they’re waiting to walk. Shall we join them?”\n“We should join them. Of course,” Ana agreed, as they began walking to join the cast of\nThe Slain\n.\n“Who are you wearing?” The lead girl asked. “I love your dress.”\n“I woke up at 5AM for glam,” said a supporting character.\n“I need to unzip this once the photos are done.”\n“I’m changing for the after party.”\n“My plus one brought me sneakers.”\n“I’m developing a blister already.”\nDuring a lull between talking points, there was a collective gasp as two girls stood sharing a screen.\n“Ana. You’re best dressed,” one said, tilting the screen so Ana could see.\n“Already?! We haven’t even walked yet,” another protested.\n“It’s so early in the day!”\n“They must have needed people to post.”\n“But your dress is so...busy.”\n“And your lipstick is so...visible.”\n“I mean, it looks great.”\n“So chic.”\n“But you’re best dressed? Not me?” The lead actress didn’t say, but she thought. Ana could sense it. In her bones. It was the implication.\nAll of the dresses were beautiful and absurd, and all of the girls looked like alien Barbie dolls, not women or girls.\nWhen the time came for\nThe Slain\ncast to grace the red, Ana was relegated to the edge of the frame. Put in her place. She was on the fringes of fame. Begging for breadcrumbs. Desperate to be here. Uninvited and unnecessary.\nBut the photographers were none the wiser, and they remembered her.\n“Ana! Over here! Over here!”\nDirty looks and insecurity seeped into the poses. The casemates smized so hard their nostrils flared, and forehead veins risked bursting.\nWhen the time came to part ways and head to their seats, a supporting character asked, “Are we all sitting together in row AA,” knowing full well Ana was not.\nShe was banished to the realm of the mezzanine, where wannabes and Television Academy Members paid their way into relevance.\nIn her seat, she unbuckled her heels and let her feet breathe. She unzipped the top of her dress, too. She could relax for awhile and watch the show. No one was looking at her, and that was not a blow.\nNormally these sorts of displays lasted for too long. Dragged on forever, and never gave up. But today, she didn’t mind. This was her respite. The carpet was the show and this was her break. She would have to rally for the afterparties.\nOf course, the network had invited them to their party, and her publicist had wrangled her an invite to the official Emmy’s afterparty. But that was not enough.\n“No, you can’t be seen at only two afterparties.”\n“No?”\n“No, of course not. You have to go to at least three, ideally four.”\n“How will I have time?”\n“You’ll only stay for ten minutes, of course.”\n“Of course?”\n“Of course. You’ll stay for ten minutes so you can walk the carpet and do the rounds, then we’ll ship you off to the next one.”\n“Why? What good does that do? Shouldn’t I be networking?”\n“Ana, my dear. Haven’t you learned? It’s all for the photos. We need photos of you on carpets.”\n“But don’t I need different outfits?”\n“That’s an excellent point. I’ll message your stylist. We can do one look per carpet. Really go all out.”\n“Doesn’t it cost me $500 for every outfit?”\nThe publicist looked at Ana with such disdain.\n“It’s the Emmy’s....” The publicist said, with attitude for emphasis.\n“Of course. Sorry,” Ana said, disappearing into her thoughts.\nMoney was just money, wasn’t it? Maybe it was Buddhist of her to wear four outfits. Or five, she supposed, if she included the gown she would be wearing to the award show itself. Would she even have time to change between the Emmy’s and the first afterparty?\nAnyway, that’s how Ana got tricked into overbooking her big day.\nThe ceremony was just the beginning.\n“And the Emmy goes to....” Ana barely heard as she turned the brightness down on her phone and checked the itinerary that had been emailed to her the day prior. She’d have to change before the first afterparty. She had to get ready to maximize the night. Really go all out.\nWho was she wearing next?\nWho was she wearing?\nWho was she...?\nAll of a sudden, she couldn’t remember.\nEmily Robinson",

    "text": "I didn’t know it, but I was always just one positive STI diagnosis away from getting a small, trampy tattoo. I didn’t have any tattoos. My sister tried to get me to get one with her after a Shania Twain concert when we were visiting our cousins in St. Louis. But the divey place she found was too upstanding to allow a fourteen-year-old to leave their place with a permanent body alteration. My sister and my older cousin left with matching horseshoes on their ankles, which they saran wrapped and covered with toe socks they bought at CVS to hide them from my aunt and uncle.\nWhen my grandma died I considered getting a tattoo on my calf of her passive aggressive catchphrase  “\nyeah isn’t a word. It’s yes.\n”\nBut my grandma hated tattoos. And I didn’t really like her that much.\nBut what brought me into the shop that day was that I got it. You know\nit\n. From\nhim\n. Yes,\nhim\n. We had sex, or something like it, and I’d woken up a few days later feeling pain, dull pain, then another pain, sharp pain, then itching, horrible itching, then panic, deep panic. I went to the clinic and the doctor stripped and stirruped me and then told me that I got\nit\n. But she said don’t worry, most people get it if they don’t already have it. And she said that she noticed that I also had some bruising around the area.\n“Do you feel safe with your sexual partner?” She asked.\n“Is there some kind of pill I can take for this?” I answered.\nShe nodded, pulled off her gloves, told me to wait there. While I was waiting I looked down, down at that pink plucked chicken between my legs all bruised and bleeding and I hated it of course. I hated having it and I hated seeing it and I most of all hated feeling it. I remembered my mother then, and how she had clucked about her bedroom when I was a child, running naked with her hair down and her bush wild, in my memory pulling chiffon scarves from the dresser and pressed shirts from the closet as though her aim were not to get dressed, but to paint the air with clothes. She never seemed to remember that she was a woman or that she was naked or that she was a woman or that she had a bush. I wish I felt like she did about my body and my bush and my being a woman.\nBut instead, I wondered if the doctor would give me a free husband stich when she came back in the room. I hadn’t had kids yet but I wanted to plan ahead. Like preventative botox at 25. But when she came back all I did was say thank you and I’m sorry and she told me the pharmacy would have my medication in an hour.\nI waddled four blocks in the sun on my way to the pharmacy. I thought about the sex that got me here. He was hot at first, asked me out when I was hanging on the arm of another guy, a guy who didn’t have the guts to fuck me. He came up to me—or I came up to him. I usually am mean to guys to get them to sleep with me which I’m not saying because I think it sounds cool but just because it’s true. I don’t know why they like it but I like it because I’m already angry at them for wanting to have sex with me. But I’m angrier that I want to have sex with them. Either way I’m angry and that’s how it happened. That’s how I got it.\nI was coming up on the pharmacy and I saw a girl smoking outside of a tattoo shop. She wasn’t smoking really—she was vaping, but she still somehow made it look cool. She seemed beautiful actually. I wondered if she’d ever had what I had. She looked beautiful but the vaping made me think she was gross. Just like me. So maybe she did get this thing that I got. She had a lot of tattoos obviously. I thought maybe I could be like her. She looked at me as I walked in. She looked at me and I wondered what I looked like to her.\nI went in and was greeted by a man who was huge. He was fat and tall and his head was mostly neck. He looked up at me without pausing the video he was watching. It blasted what I think were hockey highlights.\n“Do you have an appointment?” he asked.\nI shook my head. I was surprised by his professionalism.\n“How old are you?” He asked.\nI answered.\nHe waited there while looking at me. I waited there while looking at him. I was wearing a t shirt under a short canvas dress. Which I’d chosen because I couldn’t put jeans on over the sorry state that was my crotch. I wished I’d chosen an outfit with more coverage, then he might assume I had more tats hidden under my clothes.\n“So what do you want to get?” He asked.\n“My sister died.” I said.\nHe looked disappointed and he nodded, like I’d given him the news that a family run restaurant had closed during a recession.\n“My little sister,” I added. That made him talk.\n“Damn,” he said, “I’m sorry to hear that. For real.”\n“Thank you.” I said. “Yeah so that’s why I want the tattoo. To commemorate her.”\nI wondered if the horrible energy I was giving off from recently finding out that I had an STI was passing as “dead little sister” grief.\nI wondered if my sister would use my fake death to cope with an STI diagnosis. But the exercise fell apart because she never would have done this—gotten herself here. She almost never had sex, that’s why she had a boyfriend for so long.\nMy lie made me happy, like I now had a reason to be there. A good reason. A reason a normal person would get a tattoo, like that girl vaping outside. I bet half the tattoos on her sleeve were for dead people. She seemed like a really good person.\n“What do you want?” he asked again.\nI knew I had to be sure, like I’d thought about it.\n“I want a butterfly,” I told him.\n“Right here,” I pointed to my right thigh.\nHe looked down at my thigh. Too close to the danger zone.\n“For your little sister?” He asked.\n“Actually,” I said, trying to make it conversational.\n“I have been going back and forth about whether I want it there or here.” I pointed to the back of my left elbow.\n“My sister used to pinch me here. On my arm. During family roadtrips. To Lake Michigan.”\n“What do you think?” I asked him, “Thigh or arm?”\nHe raised his eyebrows and shrugged. I felt I’d upset him.\n“Whatever you want,” he said, getting out some supplies to draw what he called “a stencil”. He said it so cavalier, as if he didn’t basically just say that my upper thigh wasn’t special.\n“Yeah,” I said, “I think my arm. My arm for sure.”\nHe looked at me for a little while longer.\n“Okay,” he said. I was relieved.\nThe whole time he was doing it, methodically drawing out the butterfly as I sat twitching and fidgeting in the corner, as he said “alright” and gestured for me to follow him back to the table without even checking to see if I was excited to come, the way he whipped out his instruments, smelling of alcohol and miming polite apathy, and holding his gun to my skin and waiting, waiting to pierce it, stain it, mark it, temper it, soil it, ruin it, all that time he didn’t know where I was. I was cast, dangling, as though floating above my body which was being touched by his body which was being held in this shitty shop which was being beaten down by the sun which was only a few blocks from the pharmacy which probably had my medication by now. And he was nowhere but dangerous, and I was gone. Gone.\nI told him to stop just in time.\nI swallowed and said stop again and he did. I got up and my thighs made a slurping sound getting unstuck from the table. He still wanted his money. I gave it to him. And as I left I looked at the wet, purple impression of a butterfly left on my arm. He was a shit drawer.\nI left the tattoo shop, the girl vaping was gone. I had to stop myself from running to the pharmacy. The stinging between my legs slowed me down, but not much.\nI was almost inside, so close I’d already set off the automatic doors when I met the gaze of a girl I knew from a thing I went to a couple weeks ago.\n“Oh, hi,” she said, turning mid stride.\nWe side hugged.\n“Hi,” I said, “What are you up to?”\nShe held out a white paper baggy and shook it lightly. A dull rattle came from the bag.\n“Oh you know,” she said, “I’m a Lexapro girly.”\n“What about you?” she said, as she said it she looked me up and down. Before I could answer she interrupted. “I like your fit. Really early Tumblr.”\nI said thanks and laughed a laugh that was just me saying “haha” but breathier. She kept looking from my shoes to the hemline of my dress. Measuring something.\n“I got a tattoo.” I said, she looked up and met my eyes.\n“Just now?” she asked. She tucked her hand with the baggy in it into herself, crossing her arms and jutting her head out, searching me.\nI laughed again, this time a real laugh.\n“It’s in a bit of a compromising place,” I said, allowing my voice to trail off.\n“Let’s just say there’s a reason I wore a short dress today.”\nShe laughed too, her eyes wild and bright, like a child’s.\n“But I can still show you,” I said, beginning to lift my dress, “if you want to see.”\nKate Nerone\nis a writer and actor based in Los Angeles.

    "text": "The park where I hung out in high school became a crater after a girl I knew screamed so loud. It blasted her and her radius to pieces and the neighbors said the dirt rained back down for five minutes. They thought it might be hail as it was also raining, and her scream just angry thunder. My girl friends took it upon themselves to play detective about it, I followed  more like a reporter. I think it’s an easy role to fill into. You are allowed to be a creep down to a trench coat. First they interviewed me though, because none of them knew her in highschool. I met them at a party where I was pretending to be a girl two years ago. I felt really powerful with my muscles bleeding through my dress. It was raining then too. My full self comes out when it’s wet because I can slide around, in and outside my body. I like to dress up a lot.\nThey knocked on my door, we were all wearing trench coats. Except theirs were much cuter and cropped. My place was a mess and I love to live in it. I think I learned that in that same park, back then, where all the candy wrappers my friends and I ate the meat of would float on top of the blades of grass, and we’d roll around and wrestle slowly.\n“Those are nice coats, where’d you get them?”\n“We’ll ask the questions here.”\nThey pushed me into my cave and came in. I am never awake in the mornings but they are. It’s rare to see them tired. The closest they get is being angry, angry they have to sleep. I felt really embarrassed for them to be in my house. It’s so filthy even though I love it. I never have anyone over. I am always naked.\n“So how did you know the deceased?”\nI felt gross remembering she was a real dead person. A real dead person I knew and touched  hands with even. We shouldn’t have to joke about everything. We shoudlnt have to joke about everythingggg!!!! I clap in my head like I’m on a game show! I want to beat the shit out of Laura and Tamra my girlfriends for making me cry in front of them it makes me so fucking upset. And stupiddd! I see myself crying from afar. And they probably think my crying is apart of the same fucking act they’re doing oh I’m selling them so well I’m\n“Oh I am selling this sooo well arent I!!!” I scream into their faces I grab a bunch of my socks and underwear and hurl it at them. I want to learn to scream as loud as Mira I want to be her in that moment I want to deactivate my fucking brain and fuck myself over and over.\nLaura grabs my arm. Her hand is cold and one of my socks is on her wrist.\n“You loved her didnt you.”\nSlip back into into some character that’s “new” but I know her. I met her before. My voice pitches up.\n“I will always love myself.”\nThey look in some kind of way I like, a look I wish could swallow me. Live inside the throat. The only time three people have held thought and hand in one for more than a moment. Tamra puts her hand on my shoulder.\n“Why did you do it, Mira?”\n“I was just so angry?”\n“You don’t know.”\nMe again.\n“I don’t think she did know. I think someone planted a bomb in her throat when she was younger and it just did what it had to.”\nWe sit on my couch if you can call it that for a moment. I love to watch time fall around us, because we’re all together now. They both play with my hand in a new and kind of flirty way. I never knew I had hands.\nWe spend the rest of the day driving, quietly and slowly to her boyfriends house who lives an hour away but it takes us four. We stop for gas ten times and walk around looking at the candy. Just looking and walking. I like to hear both of their boots on the ground. I try to play music that makes them tap their feet in the car.\nAt John’s house there’s police tape all up around and over. It wraps around the house like it must be radioactive. And it glows with the sun setting. Three cop cars. I push my way through. The cops fall aside like cardboard cutouts. In my John's room his body is blood on his mattress. His face is frozen flesh in a deep terrible sob. There’s so much blood on his pillow oh poor baby John. He wrote on the walls with his blood, in thick letters the Dolly Parton song I will always love you, not the Whitney Houston one. It was our favorite song forever.\nNicholas Wilder Forman\nis a multimedia artist and writer living in Los Angeles, California.

However, as soon as Carly finally took her big mouth to pen and paper, she was busy composing lyrics and rhyming poems, the latter of which she foolishly believed she invented at the time as “songs that you speak instead of sing”. That was dumb. Thereafter, Carly fell in unrequited love with writing, publishing sonnets in small literary magazines and eventually earning an English degree. She then started a corporate writing career in Chicago before moving to NYC in October 2023, where she’s since become a frequent flyer in the infamous Dimes Square literary circle. There, she posts and performs her free-verse, melancholic, stream-of-consciousness poems under the pen-name CJD. These past few paragraphs have been pretentious and nauseating.

    "text": "on unica zürn, i guess:\nSeptember 2023, I was on a big Hans Bellmer kick. This came after reading Mike Kelley’s\nThe Uncanny\n, the exhibition text for his 2004 Tate Liverpool curated show. I was no stranger to Bellmer’s perverse, charged, and tangled dolls, but it was his photographs that really took me back. Human flesh cohered to a singular mass, bound and compressed—like an indiscernible bundle of meat that somehow still exude warmth [(Mondobongo, 2012)]. It wasn’t like Jana Sterbak’s Vanitas:\nFlesh Dress for an Albino Anorectic\n[(Sterbak, 1987)], with its cold slabs of fresh carnage against skin just shy of collapse. Bellmer’s flesh was closer to human—but not quite. Bare, reduced to what Agamben might call “mere life.” [(Agmemben, 1998)]\nFor whatever reason, I didn’t question the mass. I knew it was human—Photoshop and AI weren’t on the table in the early 20th century. A year later, I circled back to that research and questioned the subject in the photograph, this mass wasn’t just any body—it was, of course, a person. No surprises there: it was Bellmer’s partner, Unica Zürn. An artist and writer in her own right. Come to find out, she threw herself out of Bellmer’s window in 1970 following a stint of unraveling and hospitalizations.\nHer visual work, reminiscent of the diaristic ballpoint pen drawings I've grown too familiar with from my middle school days on tumblr. confessional portrayals of angst and anguish I had no business seeing at the time. Maybe if I didn't come in with this pre association, I'd appreciate them more but looking at them now, evokes the same feeling I get when I see a 4 loko, nausea and a twinge of embarrassment, how childish.\nAnyways I'm not here to speak ill of the dead, overlooked and unwell.\nWhat really piqued my interest of Zürn’s work was her writing, or more so a writing.\n“Since yesterday I know why I am making this book: in order to remain ill for longer than is correct. I can slip in a fresh page every day... My better half, who is clever and wise, wants me to remain ill for sometime, for it knows that one can gain from an illness such as mine. My worst half wants me to return to my few duties. Yes, I feel that it is time for me to show some consideration for my surroundings, which, incidentally, are not large... Perhaps I should now quickly smuggle another couple empty pages into this book? Forgetting one's duties has for me the taste of sweet cream.” [(Screenshot from a 12 page german-to-english translated excerpt of Unica Zürn’s\nHouse of Illnesses\n, uploaded by musicbloak on scribd)]\nThe desire to remain sick,\nTo stay ill\nTo remain in the hospital, the brick mother\nHow nauseating, embarrassing and childish\nthe host inside the guest inside the host:\ni am a carcass with you and stil i fear i'll be nothing without you\nso i harbor you in another room within this house of illnesses\nconjoined in a way deemed inoperable due to the likelihood of demise.\nfear rules this\nthe fear of what is left when bifurcated\ni conform to exist around the space you take up\ni bring you to every function\nand hold the door open for you as you pace a few steps behind,\nan attempt to keep you at arm length\nbut even still i let you into my room at night\nto share this bed together\nwithin this house of illnesses\nM:\ni’m in the house of an address you don’t know\ni hear the echo of your voice\nyour shouting\nyour scream.\nI startle myself, my throat hurts the next morning\nI am tired of carrying you with me everywhere I go\na tongue in a mouth in a place here on earth\nhypertrophic house scar\nfuture forebodings\nOphelia Arc",

    "text": "I’ve never stolen anything truly meaningful. Not technically. I like things that make me feel like I’m holding a secret I’m almost too careless to keep—a bar of soap, its scent blooming from my bag, lace panties clinging together like a barrel of monkeys up my sleeve, coasters from a store too pretentious to notice they’re missing. A magazine at checkout, ceramic chopstick rests, a tube of lipstick, any shade. But I’m a careful person. For example, I wouldn’t take Colette’s coat. Real rabbit, she insisted. Found at an estate sale, because at some level, everyone knows the best things belong to someone else. She was still talking about it when she met me and Michael for dinner.\n“It’s the most environmentally conscious thing to do,” Colette said, grabbing a menu. “Wearing fur, I mean. The fake stuff looks good, but it’s so much worse. It just stays there, in the landfill.\nForever\n.”\nColette’s coat was slung over her chair. I thought about the sensation of the beige fur beneath my fingers, soft and yielding, its weight on my shoulders, its warmth pressing down on my collarbones, how tension feels when it’s drawn tight, the sting of pressure when it finally snaps.\n“Since when did you care about the environment, Colette?” Michael peered around the restaurant for our waitress, a youngish girl with pencil-thin eyebrows who was, at most, spiritually present. “If you start thinking about what’s right and what’s wrong, you’ll never live. I mean you were vegan once, right?”\n“For two years,” I corrected, raising an eyebrow. This was back when Michael and I dated, back when he was straight, back when I thought I could stop my hunger for things I shouldn’t want. We were both wrong, of course.\n“And it was miserable,” he said. It wasn’t a question, but I knew he was asking for confirmation.\n“\nMiserable\n,” I finished my drink. At the table next to us, a couple split a steak. I liked the\nclink\nof the knife as it met the plate, how quickly they sopped the blood and grease with a torn piece of baguette.\n“That’s what I’m saying,” Michael said. “I hate to complain–I really do–about there being no such thing as ethical consumption, whatever, whatever, but at the end of the day, we’re\nhumans\nwith\nneeds\n….”\nThe conversation drifted. Across the room, at the bar, a man in a suit unbuttoned his collar. He was politician-handsome, silver hair slicked back over a boyish face. Tall. Slender. I watched the motion of his fingers, his watch catching the soft amber light. I leaned in just enough to see him notice me. I pressed my thighs together. The sharp edges of my chair bit into my legs.\n“And they’re doing all of that in a petri dish. Can you imagine that?” said Michael. “Lab-grown\nmeat\n?”\n“Yeah, weird,” I said. “Has anyone seen our waitress?”\nColette drummed her fingers on the table. “I think she went for a cigarette.”\n“That’s the other thing,” Michael said, tearing into what little remained in the bread basket. “Nobody wants to work for anyth–”\n“I’m getting another drink,” I said, rising from my seat.\nAn old mirror hung from across the bar, distorting my reflection as I slipped into the empty seat beside the man in the suit. This restaurant used to be different. People say that about every place you go to in the city, but there was a time when things were actually different—tables full of old men, regulars reading\nthe New Yorker\nover plates of rabbit and ketchupy steak tartare in the back. The menu is the same, but nobody eats. It’s hard to have an appetite in a city that asks for so much just to give you a $26 martini to sip on under a framed photo of a B-list actor in return.\n“Too loud over there?” the man in the suit asked. A tea candle flickered between us, throwing a soft light against his knuckles and two tumbler glasses, empty except for the remnants of something not quite orange or brown.\nI said I’ve never stolen anything meaningful, and I mean that. In the beginning, I was just reallocating resources necessary in order to move out of a model apartment, and it was easy in the bars and the clubs, where jackets were piled next to tables covered in bottles of vodka and cranberry juice. Most of the time I’d find coke baggies, tubes of chapstick, and receipts in the pockets, bobby pins, gum wrappers, the usual garbage. Other times, I’d find some loose change I could dump into a mason jar in my room, a ring I could sell online, and if I were lucky, a wallet.\nI always thought wallets were such strange, sacred things, the center of someone’s life and only mine for a fleeting moment. As I rifled through student IDs, loyalty punch cards, and neatly folded bills, I’d imagine all the choices that led their owner to me. Desire is like that, I think—an invisible thread pulling people through a series of seemingly justifiable events.\nI tilted my head to get a better view of the man’s face. His jaw was sharp but softened with age. His eyes were a pale, near colorless blue. Almost foggy. Good. My pulse thundered in my ears, blood rushing so loudly I almost didn’t hear the faint clink of his watch against the bar as he gestured for another drink. He was saying something, but I couldn’t hear\nwhat\n. I smiled and watched his gaze shift from the bartender to my eyes, my lips.\nI remember reading somewhere that all desire is rooted in shame, but I don’t think shame is a bad thing. Not in the way people make it out to be. Shame makes desire\nreal\n. It makes you fuck people you shouldn’t and ignore the interest quietly building as you sleep and live off of dried fruit and green juice when all you want to do is sink your teeth into something that was once alive. My thoughts snapped back to Colette’s coat, how it would look on his floor, his tie in my hand, slipping free from his collar with a soft hiss–\nI felt the weight of the watch in my pocket as I returned to the table with a drink I didn’t order in hand. Michael and Colette were still talking ethics, now with a bottle of wine between them. The man in the suit turned his head toward me. He smiled, raising his glass halfway in a silent toast. He didn’t realize it yet, but he would soon. Maybe in an hour, maybe in the morning. Maybe he’d convince himself he left his watch in the bathroom or in the back of a cab. Maybe he’d never realize it was me. These are the things we tell ourselves.\nAshliene McMenamy\nis a NYC-based writer whose work has appeared in\nTeen Vogue\nand",

People passed by and said\nnothing, probably wondering why we were sat there in high\nheels and children’s clothing. Foreheads gleaming in the\nstreetlight, we powdered our faces in tiny mirrors when\nsuddenly from the shadows appeared a man in rags. He asked\nwhat we were doing and out his pocket pulled a button and\nbrass penny along with an incredibly smooth pebble. In a soft\nand melancholic voice he began to carry the tune of a song\nfrom his country. We told him we had no money and to leave\nus the fuck alone. Told him we were waiting at the corner of\nsilence and revelation and wanted to do so in peace. The\nmakeup sat on our skin like drywall dust. For a second his eyes\nwere pools of sorrow then he fucked off. We were glad he was\ngone and went back to doing our thing.\nLydia\nis a student and writer from London.\n@lydiamckimm",

    "text": "I stare at the pharmacy's pregnancy tests\nsearching for cheap,\naccurate and comprehensible.\nThey are pink boxes,\nattention seeking boxes,\nhappy boxes.\nVoices approach my pharma-location.\nQuickly, I turn my body in the opposite direction.\nI search the faces of the voices' owners and find strangers.\nA discovery that reveals my ridiculous shame.\nIn my hiding location, at the height of my eyes,\na bottle with a blue eyed baby smiles from the shelf.\nThe cardboard baby is not selling just a cough remedy, no.\nHe sells baby giggles, a joy filling sound\neven for my undesiring belly.\nHe is untreatened by my cynicism.\nThe baby knows that if he wasn't cardboard,\nI'd hide my face on my hands\nand practice other clowneries in the search for his laughter.\nI return to my tests' options.\nSome of them are on sale. Is it a time of the year\nwith low baby-making-sex?\nDoes it mean I have less chances to be impregnated?\nOr are these tests close to their best before date,\nand so should I not buy them?\nNew voices take my body into hiding\n–again I am with the still red cheeked, mid-laughter,\njoy of someone else's life baby.\nAnd again I see strangers and feel my ridiculous shame.\nIt begs people to understand:\n\"Please, believe me I know of Global Warming!\nI am not trying to have a baby!!!\" Or\n\"No, I have other dreams, I have modern dreams!\"\nThe choice of test weighting like a fetus on my womb.\nThere are tests that can tell you're pregnant\nsix days earlier than others –for a couple dollars more.\nI remind myself that my first nausea happened a month ago,\nbut can you imagine the rare bad luck that makes these 6 days relevant?\nA rare bad luck that faults my IUD, can you imagine?\nI take the couple-of-bucks more expensive test.\nI bring to the cashier waterproof mascara\nand the test. I pay in cash.\nI put the test in the most bottom of my tote bag\n–a strategic placement. But hiding is not enough.\nI want to carry a more pleasurable object, a guiltless object,\nso I leave directly to the fruterie besides the pharmacy.\nAnd there my hands meet the convenience of a bag of grapes.\nI walk around the aisles. I feel the lack of something amusing\nand my trajectory must go on. So I line up at the cashier.\nPeople line up behind me.\nOn my turn, it's revealed that the grapes were priced at 18 dollars.\nIn my hands I hold a twenty. I stare at the green plastic dead queen .\nI stare at the middle-aged man at the cashier.\nI say \"I'm sorry, I changed my mind.\"\nInstead of moving away,\nI wait for the man to say something rude.\nI keep searching on his face for a sign\nof anger or vexation.\nHe stands expressionless. Maybe he even mutters an \"OK.\"\nBut I can't quite tell and I keep looking.\nLaura Mota-Juang\nis a Taiwanese-Brazilian shameless experimentalist from São Paulo and based in Tiohtiá:ke/Montreal. She is the author of\nLight Spill\n(\nBlock Party Press\n2023), a chapbook inspired by Physic's imagination. Other than writing, Laura's current practices include analogue collage, photography, linoprinting, live modeling, dancing and events organizing.

    "text": "I stare into the fridge like I’m attending my own wake and staring into my open casket. Marble face. Blue-purple lips pressed together like irradiated, larval gummy worms. Alkaseltzer dissolving into my clouded eyes.\nMaybe it’s an addiction. Who tf knows. All I know is Bbyangel says she can’t leave food around the house because it’ll be gone by the time she’s home. Like how I told her I can’t have beer or pain killers or weed in the house or else I’m gonna get faded. Had to impose an embargo. At least during the week. Because I just have to be in the same room as that shit for the fade to hit critical mass. To be on my\ncabron\nshit. And then things start to fall apart. But during the weekend, all bets are off. Sometimes it feels like my demise is an inside job and there’s no de-escalation once it starts.\nBbyangel says if there’s food in the fridge, she knows I’m gonna eat it. And that’s not exactly an unfair summation (or a ringing endorsement.) Painfully accurate tbh. It’s not even about being hungry most of the time. It’s more about boredom. I work from home now. Spend my day hitting the fridge up every hour or so and gorging myself. Say it’s just a “snack” like how I would just have a “beer” at lunch before they got wise and fired my ass. Some strays cannot be domesticated.\nHousebreaking some strays is trying to Moss a stray bullet.\nNever came clean and told Bbyangel what happened, but that’s neither here nor there. Don’t see why disclosing that matters. Wouldn’t change anything. Still, it used to be funny when I’d eat like that. Almost endearing. She’d shake her head, say, ‘Pinche vato,’ under her breath and just laugh. Lately it’s more of a problem. I eat and eat and eat, never leaving anything for her. Not even scraps. Though leaving scraps would probably be more insulting than anything. Like,\nWtf do you think I am, bro, a dog?\n‘\nY las flautas? No me dejaste nada?\n’ she asks when she gets home from the salon she works at, ‘\nComiste todas?\n’\nI talk in a passive mumble like a kid getting scolded and avert my eyes, like she neutered me and wears my severed nuts on a necklace to send a mfing message, ‘\nEstaba alli…Tuve hambre…idk.\n’\n‘\nTe dije que quiero comerlas cuando regreso del trabajo. Lo recuerdas?\n’\nShe looks at me like I just peed with the toilet seat down (which, full disclosure, I might have done as well.) I wring my hands and look at my chancla-sheathed feet, ‘\nPues, si…pero…tuve un chingo de hambre…\n’\nI don’t really have anything else to say. Barely understand what the big deal is tbh. I’ve always been a Bermuda Triangle of shame. We sit in our cramped Tijuana apartment. Vomit-green walls and ramshackle kitchen tucked into one corner. A makeshift sink with a rack to dry dishes. Hot plate on top of the mini-fridge in lieu of a stove. Toaster in lieu of an oven with a dehumidifier that emits resplendent luminescence. Changes colors every few seconds. Microwave mounted like a TV in a\ntaqueria\n. A giant shoe rack we use as a dresser and handrails converted into a place to hang clothes. Cold, unforgiving concrete walls like in a jail cell. Damp, suffocating air. Faux-wood flooring.\nOutside, it’s car horns blaring. Dogs barking at dogs barking at dogs barking. Someone yelling for my neighbor\nPepe\noutside his house every hour because doorbells aren’t a thing here. It’s what dogs are for lol. Dead ass. Doesn’t matter if it’s 2 P.M. or 3 A.M., someone’s out there yelling his name. The silence in our apartment is still more deafening than the cacophony outside. It’s altitude clogging my ears and cotton balls stuffed in my skull. Bbyangel tells me I have a problem. I know that means she’ll add that shit to the long list of amendments she’d like to make to my constitution.\nEvery girl has a list. And the lists never stop.\nShe wastes no time sending me to the editing bay. She never does and sometimes I think it’s what made me fall in love with her in the first place.\nI light a cigarette and stare up at the white ceiling. Think this must be what she feels like when she prays and convinces herself God will sort all her shit out on her behalf, like he/she/they/it were just a cosmic fiduciary with a existential power of attorney. Only costs your soul to enlist their services. Surrendering to a higher power.\n‘I have a plan,’ she says, ‘To work on this. Make a solution.’\nShe’s all about finding solutions. I’m more about pretending the problem doesn’t really exist in the first place. If it doesn’t self-correct, I’m more than happy to just let it fall apart. Like, maybe—\njust maybe\n—you can will these things into non-existence. Reverse manifestation.\n‘What’s that?’ I ask. Somehow relieved at the simple prospect of a plan.\nShe’s always treating our relationship like a math equation or shitty car that keeps breaking down you won’t replace because you can’t afford to. While I treat it like a litter box in which I defecate and wait for someone else (usually her) to change.\n‘We won’t keep food around the house anymore. Only when we’re going to eat. So you won’t be tempted. Maybe this is how you can learn to control yourself.’\nThe truth is this probably cuts her deeper than me because she metes out her love for me in food. Each dish is an overture. A literal expression of her love. Deprivation and over-indulgence are two sides of the same coin for me, and that coin, that emotional currency, is my love language.\nMi idioma de amor\n. We’ve always had a tacit understanding of how this works. An unspoken contract that binds this relationship. Like, as long as one of those extremes is on the table and ready for me to dig in, we’re in good shape. As long as we have that\nefectivo\n, we won’t go bankrupt.\nIt sometimes feels like there are two people inside me: someone on the brink of death on a hunger strike for some undeterminable (but definitely\nlost\n) cause and someone who sees\nMy 700 Pound Life\nthe same way kids see making the league. The one on hunger strike, feeding the other all the food he’s petulantly refusing to eat in some twisted iteration of a feeder fetish, creating a toxic, codependent relationship with myself.\nBtw, I’m thoroughly convinced most Mexican girls have a feeder fetish the way they stuff you with food until you’re practically insensate, at which point they conveniently always start difficult conversations when you barely have the energy to move let alone push back. But me? I just smile like a suture. Exhale a gaunt contrail of smoke. My lungs get tight. My chest starts hurting. My breaths get short and shallow.\nI marvel at how she really\ngets me\n. I realize something in that moment:\nThere are two kinds of people in this world, her and everyone else.\nLike always, I’m on board at first. We start going to Calimax and purchasing food like a Doomsday Cult thoroughly convinced the world will end each night.\nLately, every day feels like my own personal apocalypse.\nYou don’t know trust satiation—satisfaction—until every meal is your last meal.\nLife hasn’t felt so good in a while.\nWe eat dinner with the intent of not having leftovers the next day. A license to binge for the entire night. Feel like this is what I was put on earth to do. Like what Jordan must have felt the first time he touched a basketball. I wake up the next day feeling gross. Practically hungover. I’m my own experimental DIY taxidermy project stuffed with excrement like a diaper instead of cotton. I step outside and light a cigarette. Yawn, burp, and stretch. Rub my eyes with the back of my hand.\nThe sun and clouds look sewn onto the sky like shitty punk patches on a denim vest. Scroll through my phone with a crack like a lightning bolt running down the middle. Retribution from a vindictive God. I start mapping out the freelance work I have that day and think about the conversation when I was stupefied by gluttony the night prior. Got into uncomfortable territory. Bbyangel is in therapy, actively works on herself. She’s all about self-improvement and bettering herself. Told me I should start doing things to give back to the world. Acts of service. She alleges it’d help.\nI joked that this is new territory for me, and historically speaking, exploring uncharted territory doesn’t yield the most judicious or humanitarian results. Like, I’m just gonna eradicate and oppress whatever those mechanisms are I have yet to encounter. She hits me with a reverse\nUno\ncard and says it’s typical colonizer speak to equate my debased impulses to indigenous people.\nWhat can I say? When she’s right, she’s right.\nI draw more cards, apologize, and keep it pushing.\nI wasn’t entirely convinced, but I capitulated. Even believed it almost. Usually when she talks to me about bettering myself, I say something along the lines of, ‘\nYou can’t polish a turd,\n’ which apparently gets less funny each time I say it. Diminishing returns type beat. But I’d gone comatose and just laid decommissioned. Fish eyes. Breathing like a ventilator. Sometimes day-to-day living is being on life support for me. I listened to her like I was in a state of sleep paralysis and she was a grisly, shadowy demon visiting me. Couldn’t really rebuke or evade her. Just had to lie there and let her water board me with her care and concern like a wrongly interred prisoner. I’d gladly give up the answers she was trying to torture out of me if I had them. But I never do.\nThough I’m by no means innocent.\nLove sometimes feels like a stint in Guantanamo.\nCut to right now. She’s at work. It’s just me and Tuna, our cat, in the apartment.\nNo food. No brew. No weed. No Tramadol. No\nnothing",

Sylvia’s two braids tied back every day. Sylvia dancing on the patio. Sylvia hiding in the back of my closet. Sylvia in a tie-dyed T-shirt from sleepaway camp. Sylvia on a bicycle. Sylvia in an aquarium. Sylvia on the class field trip to the Bronx Zoo, where we sat by the lion exhibit all day. The gap closing between Sylvia’s two front teeth. Middle school pool parties behind Sylvia’s big, yellow house. Avoiding the weird statue that stared from the corner of her yard. Sylvia throwing a carton of milk at Logan Thomas. Detention with Sylvia. Sylvia promising she wouldn’t tell anyone I cried. That Halloween when we both dressed up as witches, the last one before stuff like that would matter. Sylvia’s new haircut, just above her shoulders. Sylvia’s white sneakered feet beneath the bathroom stall door. Sylvia through the window of a classroom—understanding I’ll always be the moon to her bright Sun. Sylvia’s warm cheek pressed against my stomach. Sylvia’s name like daggers from his lips. Buying makeup finally, like Sylvia always did. Sylvia in my nightmares. Sylvia on the phone. Suddenly noticing how tall I had gotten. A greying friendship bracelet in the back of my desk drawer. Sylvia on Owen Moore’s Instagram story. Sylvia asleep on my twin bed. Sylvia’s black Subaru, in my driveway less and less. Sylvia’s location, frozen at her house. Sylvia’s vacant gaze as I pass her on the street. Wondering if Sylvia ever liked me at all. Sylvia in the dark somewhere alone.\nSylvia’s locker unopened for months now. Sylvia’s prom dress on the returns rack at Goodwill. Sylvia’s face, placid and unaware, staring from the posters all over town. Three policemen greeting Mom at my front door. Having to admit a million times that I hadn’t spoken to Sylvia in a year or so. The silence after Sylvia’s name at graduation. Sylvia’s poor dad, alone in the tavern on a Tuesday night. Sylvia’s Subaru that her little brother won’t take. Sylvia’s birthday: I’ll notice every year. Owen at Sylvia’s vigil. Pictures from our middle school graduation on the local news. Sylvia’s Jansport backpack, found abandoned near I-81. Owen’s screams echoing down the school hallway. Sylvia spreading everywhere and onto everybody. Sylvia on the playground, blood running down her skinny shins. Standing by the bus stop, squinting against the rising sun to see where Sylvia went. Her small body and huge, pink backpack crouched by the side of the road. My eyes adjusting to the brightness, approaching and seeing a squirrel, squished flat on the road. I gag.

    "text": "God said “Let the earth bring forth every kind of living creature: voids, creeping things, wailing women.” And it was so. God made wild beasts of every kind and aching stomachs of every kind, and all kinds of things creeped on the earth. And God saw that this was good, which implies the existence of Not Good, which did not apply to the wailing women, the aching stomachs, the voids, the wild beasts, or the creeping things.\nGod went on to make other things too, like nail polish and Dark Souls 3, and God made death, too, just as they made life, for each portal into the world necessitates a portal out of it, creating life is the same as offering a sacrifice.\nSophia Tempest\nis a poet who lives in Philadelphia. Her chapbook, a lamb hangs by its own foot, was released with Ghost City Press in 2019. Her full length collection, WHEN I GET TO HEAVEN, was released with Another New Calligraphy in 2022. Her work has appeared in blush lit, discount guillotine, Sobotka, and elsewhere. She can be found on instagram\n@sophiatempest\n.",

There was us and then there wasn’t. Your new keys and a room temperature bottle of champagne. I told you if you took a sip while it overflowed and made a wish, it would come true. You asked me if I made one and I sheepishly said I made two. The first was for you to get naked and the second was for you to stay that way. I fear maybe I cursed my real one that day by making light of the act of wishing. I heard you have real furniture now, no more Chinease food on cold floors. That’s a shame, as it made you slightly more relatable in your shiny new castle. Secretly I guess I’m glad that I only got to see that side, plastic cutlery and orange sauce dripping from your lip.

    "text": "Having never bought Plan B before, I referred to the RiteAid cashier, a South Asian woman who looked to be clocking off. “Behind the counter, yes,” she’d answered morosely. I had been searching for them near the condoms in the feminine care/family planning section. Clearly this had been naïve. Instead, emergency contraceptives could be found amongst all the things that contained nicotine: cigarettes, gums, lozenges, chews. After my brief exchange with the cashier, I floated over to the frozen section for a pint of ice cream, returned to the register, waited in a short line, and was helped by a different cashier, an older, straight-backed, white woman with dyed hair. She casually placed the Plan B next to my ice cream without a word about it, rung me up, and intuitively began putting both my items into a bag, though I had not asked for one. As I turned to walk out, she said “God bless you” with a certain feeling.\nI wondered. I assumed she overheard my question to the other cashier. Perhaps she was trying to treat me delicately as I was clearly unaccustomed to buying Plan B. Maybe I reminded her of someone. But there was a real care overlaying her few actions towards me, a care I have not always known to emanate from RiteAid employees.\nI wish the same cashier had been there when I came back a week later to buy a 28-pack of Always Infinity FlexFoam Pads (Size 3, Heavy Flow). She had been insistent on FlexFoam due to her sensitivity to textures. And, I wondered, standing at the register, had the same cashier seen me, would she bless me again?\nFrank Demma\nis a writer, director and performer living and working in Los Angeles.

    "text": "The arms manufacturer is moonlighting as a poet, or at least some kind of meme artist, and the would-be writers are all turning into beetles as his guests do coke off the sleeve of a collectible copy of Joni Mitchell’s Blue on the sofa. In the bathroom, there are only mirrors no floor and a bottle of benzos and animals kept in a glass terrarium and a leopard stuffed and a hung-up mirror covered in hooker lipgloss kisses which have been collecting mildew like warehouse silk.\nOh, God please take me up to heaven and by heaven I mean please take me out of this city and deposit me in the forest to grow lean and gentle. I will kiss the soil a thousand times, and grow religious in some fashion, and I will then be clean and then I will try it all again but this time I’ll be smarter. There is some hedonism, there is some tragedy, there is something wrong, there is something beyond this city where we have too much, maybe there is something to be said for noticing it all.\nLillian Mottern\nis a writer from Los Angeles. Her writing has been featured in Spectra, The Big One, Wigleaf, Waif, and The Living Room, among others. She is co-editor of Perennial Magazine and curates the experimental lit project Future Darling.\n@lillianmottern",
