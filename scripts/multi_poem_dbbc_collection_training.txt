Over summer, I do ketamine 6 times in one week with an 80 year old anesthesiologist. He says we’re fixing my hard drive. Pills are for software issues. Ketamine loves estrogen, he emphasizes. His sloth-covered office. A pretty girl like you, he says, should feel like a Disney Princess. I laugh, never showing my teeth.
The ritual goes as follows,
1.  Eat a bowl of oatmeal. Drink a small yellow Gatorade. Arrive.
2.  Public restrooms circle Hell. Pee in Hell.
a. Avoid pissing your pants in Not Hell.
3.  Enter a cold room. Accept a white blanket. Use the same vein. Turn off the lights.
4.  Take a flash photo. Send it to your mother.
5.  Feel close to God for an hour. Understand. It’s all so simple. Simple, but still.
a. Bailey tells me sex on ketamine is supposed to be really intense. He knows exes that fell back in love after it. I tell him, that makes sense. On ketamine I’m in love with everyone.
6.  Drink water from a paper cup. Walk back to the restroom. Pee. Still coming down. Take a flash photo in the mirror. Attach yourself to reality. Send it to your mother.
7.  Depart.
a. Go shopping. See a bunny. Name it Context.
b. Get lost. Go home.
8.  In bed. Pour over hundreds of screenshots.
a. Laugh. Then cry. And sleep.
b. Wake up wanting.
According to an arbitrary rating system after each session, I am 11% better. I clap a gnat to death. A big boom for a minuscule thing. The acupuncturist loses a needle in me. The Uber has fake grass for a floor. He wishes me good luck in all my beginnings. But it’s my ends that need the wishing. It’s that quarter of my soul, stolen by a cokehead highschooler in 2010. Three quarters of a wish.

We’re in a post-Bret Easton Ellis world

wasn’t that the New York School?
I’d have a Coke with you
but your teeth would rot.        Your teeth
are most precious     a neighborhood of
pre-gentrification dive bars to smoke inside.
People are afraid
to merge but this isn’t a freeway.
There are no signs
of life besides the bellhop.
We don’t have bags, only desires.
Drive us into the Hudson
in a rented Jaguar as I give you head.
My teeth stay hidden

i fell in love with a guy because he ubered me home from the old bar
i can’t visualize his face
even though i had my own side to his bed
i shouldn’t be left around applebee’s margarita buckets
i’ll drunk text before 9 pm
i used to be psychic but all i could predict
about you was when you would tell me to get down on my knees
i liked you
even though you called american spirit blues greens
and the fact you have red scare premium either makes you a pervert or a girl
the first night i met you i whispered in your ear
“i’d do whatever u told me to”
and you plopped an olive in my mouth
god is a 34 year old man and he smokes strawberry mango elfbars

I love you.
and you are looking at me
like I am so so dirty
and you tell me
I smell like the strip club,
distinct,
hairspray and body spray
and sweat and other people’s
sweat.
You say you don’t
even want to fuck me
on the days that I work,
that you can feel
the other men on me.
and I already knew that
but hearing you say it
out loud makes it
so much worse.
So I always go home to shower
before coming back to yours
after my shift,
so it’s a good thing
we’re neighbors.
You are so accessible that way.
If I am drunk,
I won’t even think about it
unless you are begging me to come,
so you can hate it out loud
and in front of me
and still have me
sleeping next to you.
I swore to never change,
when the other girl in the dressing room
says
a man can never really be okay
with it, and love you,
I laugh
but here I am, washing myself off for you
and you tell me you can still smell it,
you can still feel it
and so the shower was useless
but at least I am trying.

Me and the girls got all dressed up to sit on the pavement at the
corner of silence and revelation. People passed by and said
nothing, probably wondering why we were sat there in high
heels and children’s clothing. Foreheads gleaming in the
streetlight, we powdered our faces in tiny mirrors when
suddenly from the shadows appeared a man in rags. He asked
what we were doing and out his pocket pulled a button and
brass penny along with an incredibly smooth pebble. In a soft
and melancholic voice he began to carry the tune of a song
from his country. We told him we had no money and to leave
us the fuck alone. Told him we were waiting at the corner of
silence and revelation and wanted to do so in peace. The
makeup sat on our skin like drywall dust. For a second his eyes
were pools of sorrow then he fucked off. We were glad he was
gone and went back to doing our thing.

I try my best to make the legs that support me
look like sticks.
They click like hooves on the cement.
I stand on shoes with heels like twigs.
I keep my calluses smooth and my skin
fresh.
My torso is adorned with fur that puffs up in the wind.
I tilt my head and place one hand on my collar
when lighting my cigarette.

The cool thing
about violence
is that I have never
ever hurt anyone
I have eaten sandwiches
and gained
a lot of respect
for Italy
because they managed
to convince the world
that all French people do
is be poor
get sick
sing arias
and die
so imagine my shock
upon entering
Madame Tussauds
and seeing conquerors of nations
rendered as wax figures
with itty bitty
baby carrot
crotches
an essentially Greco-Roman error
although one wonders
if it was not for modesty
that ancient sculptors carved
such small manhoods
but an actual failing
on the part
of men
one must wonder such things
even Christ had his doubts
