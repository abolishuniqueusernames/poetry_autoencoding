Over summer, I do ketamine 6 times in one week with an 80 year old anesthesiologist. He says we’re fixing my hard drive. Pills are for software issues. Ketamine loves estrogen, he emphasizes. His sloth-covered office. A pretty girl like you, he says, should feel like a Disney Princess. I laugh, never showing my teeth.
The ritual goes as follows,
1.  Eat a bowl of oatmeal. Drink a small yellow Gatorade. Arrive.
2.  Public restrooms circle Hell. Pee in Hell.
a. Avoid pissing your pants in Not Hell.
3.  Enter a cold room. Accept a white blanket. Use the same vein. Turn off the lights.
4.  Take a flash photo. Send it to your mother.
5.  Feel close to God for an hour. Understand. It’s all so simple. Simple, but still.
a. Bailey tells me sex on ketamine is supposed to be really intense. He knows exes that fell back in love after it. I tell him, that makes sense. On ketamine I’m in love with everyone.
6.  Drink water from a paper cup. Walk back to the restroom. Pee. Still coming down. Take a flash photo in the mirror. Attach yourself to reality. Send it to your mother.
7.  Depart.
a. Go shopping. See a bunny. Name it Context.
b. Get lost. Go home.
8.  In bed. Pour over hundreds of screenshots.
a. Laugh. Then cry. And sleep.
b. Wake up wanting.
According to an arbitrary rating system after each session, I am 11% better. I clap a gnat to death. A big boom for a minuscule thing. The acupuncturist loses a needle in me. The Uber has fake grass for a floor. He wishes me good luck in all my beginnings. But it’s my ends that need the wishing. It’s that quarter of my soul, stolen by a cokehead highschooler in 2010. Three quarters of a wish.

ad of myself staring back with my expiration date stamped across my forehead, but 10 years younger. Like those pictures on milk cartons.
I stare at my reflection like watching bird shit dry on a windshield.
They say everything has an expiration date. Who tf knows if that’s true.
One can only hope we’re so lucky.
Don’t know why but it feels like I should mention Tuna is more of a step-cat. Bbyangel had her when we started dating, and they were a package deal. When she moved in, it was just something I had to accept. Newton’s Third Law type beat.
I accepted Tuna the same way Bbyangel makes me eat veggies when she makes me
algo rico
. I kept making jokes about how I was gonna put her in the
calle
. How I’d find a way to get rid of her. That she’d just disappear one day. I wouldn’t actually do it obvi. But it’s the only way I know how to flirt. Autism is my love language.
The thing I didn’t account for is growing so fond of the cat. That I’d even start loving it and would be the one getting in trouble for spoiling it. Even spoiling it to be passive aggressive and piss Bbyangel off occasionally. Love is a proxy war.
I guess my point is this only makes the ordeal all the more fucked up.
Jealous of our child on some Oedipal
ish
.
I need something to quiet the thoughts. Something to abate them at least. I sit on the couch with this dour demeanor you’d expect to see at a funeral.
Sin distracciones
, I’ll end up sitting like that for hours. Staring at the food with that same dead-eyed stare cats and dogs have when they’re shitting or peeing. Avoiding eye contact. Self-awareness rendered a byproduct of vulnerability. Reduced to a survival mechanism engrained in your instincts. Sometimes it feels like the only time I’m self-aware is when the world is plotting to snuff me out. Tho my paranoid, pot-addled, and undeveloped mind used to think it was the other way around. Bbyangel says when my brain gets obsessive and intractable, I should find a way to distract myself.
‘What do you think getting faded was?’ I want to say when she administers thrifted therapy.
Distracciones son mi idioma de amor
. Instead, I only ever nod and mumble in agreement. Never really say what I want to say. Love is a splitting atom; it’s being in dissonance. I go to the fridge like I could just will food into existence but open it and stare inside like opening a check at a restaurant you already know you can’t afford.
I should be working because I’m already behind. Usually when I feel like this, I scroll through my phone. Itinerantly bouncing from app to app like a nomad. Beat my meat every few hours until cumming feels like ripping a fart. But those impulses have been supplanted by this other thing. That bowl of food that Tuna visits intermittently. I don’t really mean to start watching it, but it just happens. Sounds like a cop out, but I don’t know how else to describe it. I end up watching commercials for cat food.
Which feels even more humiliating to admit than watching furry porn involving two people dressed as cats. I scroll through a few before I find the one I like. The one I literally watch on a loop to sate my hunger like an alcoholic watching
Leaving Las Vegas
to drink vicariously. Symbiotically. It doesn’t exactly make that desire subside, but it at least keeps me from getting a taste. Delays the inevitable.
The one I watch goes like this:
It starts with two cats. Airbrushed, photo-shopped, and everything as if they were insecure about how they’d appear on camera. Like, if a camera adds 10 lbs, imagine what it feels like when you barely weight 12 lbs to begin with. One even has abs.
They walk through a giant gate reminiscent of the proverbial ‘pearly gates,’
For the record, if heaven exists, I hope this is it.
They slowly enter, looking around in awe with a golden sidewalk beneath them and a giant Ferris Wheel in the background. The sky is a deep blood red, and the clouds look like purple cotton candy. It’s like a Willy Wonka Factory I’d actually want to visit.
‘It really exists. It’s Crispy’s World!’ Cat 1 says in awe, an orange and white specimen of a feline. Legit the mfing Myles Garret or Nick Bosa of cats.
‘Look at the choices!’ Cat 2 adds, a black and white cat with a gravelly voice.
‘No way—extra gravy!’ Cat 1 says, motioning with a nod to a giant volcano in the distance spouting gravy flowing like spittle down a baby’s chin.
Cat 1 hits a lever. They ride in two carts that are giant tins of cat food, looking around and traveling down a river of milk. ‘
‘Look at the little soups!’
‘And there’s the shreds of meat!’
‘Man, Crispie’s has it all—can I have it all? Pleaaassseee?’
The camera pans out to them eating a sumptuous feast of different bowls on a table, and it pans out further to show a sign erected along the gate that looks like a marquis and reads: Crispie’s Treats: Let Them Feast. A girl-ish woman’s voice reads it while another voice sings ♪ Crispie’s ♫ in a jingle after.
I watch it for hours on repeat. Hypnotized. I don’t even realize how much time passes. I start imagining it’s a real place. It becomes my
El Dorado
or
Atlantis
. Like, imagine the spoils I would enjoy after that expedition. Before I know it, it’s time for Bbyangel to get home.
Fuck
. I still haven’t gotten work done. But there’s always tomorrow. A new day means new excuses.
One day at a time. This, this is the way.
I wait until Bbyangel comes back to eat. I have no choice. Try convincing myself it’s fasting, but it’s more like convincing myself a litter box is a beach. Lol.
I look at myself in the mirror and say, ‘
Cope harder bro
.’
All I can think about is the cat food. I sit with a face like a rubber dollar-store mask staring at it. Eyes, burned out headlights in my skull. Flat, glossy, and ineffectual. I try to get work done, and manage to get through some things, but still fall further behind. I gotta get it together. But I can’t mfing concentrate now that I got a whiff of it.
Trying to push that hunger out of my mind is like trying to choke out a crash test dummy. I smelled that fistful of cat food pellets and it was like a sommelier smelling a glass of vino with the smarmy demeanor and intonation of a snake-oil salesman. Talking about the notes and undertones and all that shit and it sounding more like they were clairvoyant corresponding with the dead. I convince myself I can smell the beef, chicken, and veggies. Convince myself the chicken is free range, too. So I feel less shitty over this hunger. Like,
at least it’s ethically sourced
.
Would cannibalized hippy vegans be free-range and ethically sourced, too?
These are the tangents I let myself follow to distract myself from the hunger.
Bbyangel gets home and brings supplies for
tortas
.
Bolillos y carne asada
. I sit on the couch with all the charm of a scarecrow while she cooks. Suck at a cigarette. Scroll through my phone while
Scarface
plays muted on the TV. The scene where he drinks the water they bring him in Bolivia to wash his hands with. Eats the oranges in it and everything. Right before they hang that dude from the helicopter. Always fucking kills me. Even the smell of cooking meat can’t rout the incomparable smell of the cat food from my nose. It’s impregnable in my nostrils. I wish my senses would make sense.
‘Are you OK?’ Bbyangel asks.
‘Yeah, why?’
‘You’ve looked weird these days.’
‘Just tired.’
‘Hm. OK.’
‘What?’
‘
No te creo, pero si lo dices
.’
Shit. Never thought I’d have to worry about me snitching on myself.
It’s always the people you most expect. Stg.
I go to the tiendita while she’s cooking. Busting a mission to get more water,
frijoles
, and
aguacate
. Can’t drink water out of the tap here, and I go through about three liters of
Peñafiel
a day. Used to go all the way to Oxxo before I knew this tiendita took card. Just assumed they didn’t. A completely baseless assumption, too, tbh.
The tiendita’s right around the corner. A three-minute walk.
Pass the Chinese-themed bar. The new
Fresa
hipster spot. Hit or miss on whether it’s full. When it’s not, it’s just loud music playing to an empty beer garden and the most depressing thing you’ve ever laid eyes on. Pass the giant near-condemned house I love that Bbyangel is convinced is a
narco
safe house. Pass the house that always has a security guard posted up outside. Like, 24/7. Means someone important lives there. Bbyangel says it must be a
narco
. Says the safehouse must be for whatever narco lives there. Same security guard who greets Bbyangel with a, ‘
Buenos noches
,’ every time she passes but only ever eyes at me like I’m scheming to lick that mfing house. Shouldn’t bother me as much as it does. Passed where the
perrito
yaps and attacks me. Gets out and starts nipping at my ankles. Bbyangel would probably say that mutt has
narco
ties, too.
The tiendita is one long narrow aisle. There’s a freezer with ice cream jutting out like a barricade that bisects it so you have to walk out and around to the second door when there’s a line. Cooler with tortillas. Loosie cigarettes for sale.
Caguamas
.
Misma mierda,
differente tiendita
. Stomach’s growling like
barrio
dogs looking for scraps. I browse the store and look at the
papitas
and other junk food. There is no one else inside. Guy behind the register plays Mexican rap music on tinny phone speakers. I grab water, beans, avocado, and go to get a roll of toilet paper. On the way, I see pet food.
I see the cat food in my periphery and just stand there and stare. Transfixed. Captivates me in a way nothing else in this store does. Must be what Tuna experiences when we play sounds of cats meowing to fuck with her. To make her start going crazy. Like a psyop or MK-Ultra experiment. Scrambling her brain for shits and giggles. I look at the cat food and imagine it with
chamoy
and
Valentina’s
.
A little
limon
for good measure.
Fuck it, might as well make it like
tostilocos
.
I stand there so long my mouth starts watering. My eyes glaze over. I go full Smeagol staring at the cat food. Look at the different flavors.
Pescado. Pollo. Atun. Res.
I start wondering how they taste. See the fancy, wet food and the dry kibble, and wonder what it’s like to indulge in the former. How much better it must taste. Seems more decadent. Comfort food for cats. I snap out of it eventually and glance at the guy working the register. He looks at me like I’m out my box.
I go over, pay, and leave. Light a cigarette as soon as I step outside. Need to calm my nerves. Can’t stop thinking about the food. The menu of options. Decide to check the flavor of what we have later. Bbyangel gives me the same spiel when I get back. Tells me I should work on myself. Talks about bettering myself.
I agree but keep it noncommittal. Because my feet stay cold, bro. Like Antonio Brown’s. Iykyk. I tell her I’ll see what I can do to put a few of her recommendations into practice. See if it makes a difference. Baby steps. I even believe I will for a minute even though we both know I won’t. She insists on therapy, and I hit her with a strong,
Tal vez
.
‘Baby,’ she says as she’s finishing the tortas, ‘You know you talk in your sleep? You’ve been saying a lot of stuff the last few nights.’
Hijo de puta
. I worry I spilled the
frijoles
on myself. Feels less like spilling the beans and more like a gas leak.
‘What do I say?’ is all I think to ask. Heart races. Stomach torques.
‘You keep asking,
Is this bad ass?
You ask it over and over and over.’
Lol. On brand, bro. We both laugh, and I feel something like relief.
I manage to stomach the food and eat until I can’t move and then lay on the couch like a blanket draped over it. I eat like a semi-sentient garbage disposal. Think of the cat food the whole time. I wait until Bbyangel’s asleep, which means Tuna’s asleep. So the coast is clear. I even pretend talking in my sleep so she thinks I’m asleep and goes to sleep.
Yeah, I know.
It’s a whole thing
.
When I’m convinced I’m the only one awake, I get up as quietly as possible and avoid sudden movements. I get on my hands and knees and slowly crawl to the food. I glance over my shoulder, and Tuna’s woken up. I see her big eyes staring at me like two curious searchlights. Hope she doesn’t move. Raise my index finger to my lips like,
shhh
. She actually listens for once. I inch closer and closer to her food bowl. When I get to it, I grab one of the pebbles and look at it like an artifact. Like it was something precious. Like treasure I found. Hold it to my nose again and basically get high off it. Was absolutely stuffed before smelling it, but I’m famished afterward.
Fuck
. Look back, and Tuna’s still staring at me like I was an animal in the zoo. I look at the pebble for a few minutes, pop it in my mouth like a painkiller, and chew. It’s harder than I expected, but it tastes like nothing I’ve had before.
It’s like chewing on a rock at first. I can’t help but think of that
Strange Addictions
episode about the woman who’s addicted to eating rocks. Like, Bro,
I finally get it
. Only thing I can liken it to is when someone finds religion late in life and sees the light. When they have that moment of clarity that saves their soul. I put another in my mouth, then another, and I try deducing the flavor like wine tasting. Roll them around with my tongue. After deliberation, I land on chicken.
I decide I’ll check to see if I’m right the next day.
It feels like I’m going to wake up with purpose. That I have a mission, something akin to a crusade. Can’t tell you the last time I went to bed feeling like the next day wouldn’t amount to little more than a stamped out cigarette butt you scrape off the sidewalk or dredge out of an ashtray and get a few drags out of praying to God it’s not
menthol
. After eating that food, I go to bed more sated than I’ve been in years. Normally, I’d stare at my phone screen into the early hours or morning, wake up feeling like shit, and suffer through the day. But I don’t even feel the need to do that tonight.
That compulsion is attenuated.
I simply am, and that’s finally enough.

My dream dinner party guest is a clementine spotted sunfish.
I’d wear a candy red dress right up to top thigh, awfully vibrant in the riverbed, in the silty section of the shallows. We both arrive at eight. I dip in slow, reserved and bitchy as midwinter warm with only good intentions. I’ve got cinnamon stick legs, and grapefruit spit glistening lips perfect for an innocent well timed bloom, saying just the right thing with the right amount of breath. The fish watches me descend. He never blinks.
It’s good to see you.
The table’s all set with rose colored radicchio, dark wine stain skinned plums, and green beans in lavish garlic lying lazily round baby blue candlesticks with honey white flames that flicker in river tempo. In jade vases squirm coontails, hydrilla and water hyacinth. There’s green grapes, pears, mandarins and miniscule crustaceans, little invertebrates delicate as desire all ivory and gold lounging sideways in the algae with their hips tilted up. I’ll tilt my hips too.
The sunfish brazen sips from my martini glass and leans forward to feel my cold human hands which he holds on to for too long. I blush twenty shades of snapdragon. He’s lovely. He’s turquoise and tomato red, juicy vesicles from mythological citrus. His tongue is toothless, with a mouth position deemed
terminal
in encyclopedias. I did my research beforehand. He knows. He can tell how I feel by my darkening indigo eyes. In response, he performs powerful sweeping motions with his caudal fin. He’s a little fuckboy.
I take full responsibility for this fantasy.
Ragtime piano plays.
During dinner I'll explain my theory of moral change. You must assume full agency, avoid resentment at all costs. The fish will say he saw another ex lover the night before and she told him he’s like a character in a poorly reviewed film. I imagine her tits heavy, her dark hair parted over to one side. I’ll say that up on dry land I no longer speak to women, only boys in big pants who dance to Black Eyed Peas on a Sunday afternoon in an empty bar with no concern for wealth. The fish asks what I really value. I say,
Freedom
. The fish will say their father is an asshole which we knew beforehand. He lives out west in a childhood home, fully regressed egg state. I lower my chin in coy sympathy. In this way, we will participate in confession in a less than catholic sense.
The meal moves on into spiced ginger, smeared butter lemon slice tinged teeth and empty shells set aside for minimal home decor later on. There’s cola, figs, and parsley dipped in tears like at a messianic passover dinner in a southern baptist home then the music shifts into easy harp like a grecian dream when I place my fingernails on my lips while he messes up his hair. Our cadence slows. Here in the cobalt we sit quietly, the sunfish and I, lapping up the lusciousness. It's a delight to hold my breath this long. It's orgasmic.
I’ll explain my hope to one day live fulltime in bad water, the brackish kind that’s salty enough to scrape these salacious perl barnacles off my flesh. There’s a virtue to saying no, certainly, a virtue like a spotted throbbed banana peel sitting on a windowsill waiting to be made into bread.
I’ve got to get better.
Then the fish might look at me, with lust in his eyes and ask
so what are we doing?
I’ll lean forward to say,
I don’t care, I’m so full of joy.
I’m flickering, quivering and the fish feels it against his pointed pectoral fin. We return to the concept of agency, nightmares, and grasshoppers dancing round on from sharp hooks floating too and fro. At the end of dinner the fish might finish off my last cigarette and say
you shouldn’t see me again.
When I protest the fish might say
I want you so fucking much. Get out of my fucking car.
I sit spread open on the riverbank, white takeout box in hand. I’m soaking wet honey. I’m dripping down the soaked crimson fabric fingering my nipples and seeping into the mossy soft of the land that stands between the fish’s home and the county road. I’m humiliated. I’ll never love again. Instead I’ll wring out my hair until it's white as the sun, I’ll grow my metallic nails longer, decorate my ears with medium sized dry jewels. The river water scent will nestle into my lungs until I’m something else than human. I’m a bivalve shellfish, zebra striped like a whore in 2002 and I halt the means of production with my stubbornness. I stay and stay and stay.
While I wait, I eat maraschino cherries straight out of the jar. I think of future dinners with salamanders, bass, and horned toads. I slice open kiwis I never really wanted to consume. Besides, I don’t have a spoon. I’ll toss some of these sweetnesses back down in the river. There, enjoy.
I read on a website orange spotted sunfish have a high tolerance for the opaque. They like low gradients, gravel, warm water and cottonwood roots. They also like soda water, strawberry flavored vape pens, self help books and blondes. Moreover, they are very good at explaining their moral failures. From the shallows of the Brazos they text
I care about you so much.
It doesn’t matter, really. It was just a get to know you kinda question.
God, it's so silty. It’s liquid coal velvet slipping down my neck.
There,
the fish had said,
dream about that.
Steven asks another icebreaker:
What kind of music do you listen to?
This is not going to end well.

part one - the fish
the oldest animal currently in captivity is a tortoise named jonathan who lives at an animal rescue center on st. helena’s island in the southern atlantic ocean. jonathan is 191 years old. okay, grandpa!
the youngest animal currently in captivity is, statistically, a tamarin monkey born during the time it took you to finish reading this sentence. (i made that up but for all intents and purposes, let’s continue).
when i was eight years old i got my first pet: a small orange goldfish. my sister wanted to name the fish something gay like “goldy” or “sparkles”, but i was the one who stole the fish out of the fat kid’s basket at pet smart so we both decided that i would get to name it.
after much thought and consideration, i decided to name our new pet after my favorite actor at the time: jason segel.
when we got home, we put jason segel on a shelf in our room and watched him bang his head into the glass over
and over
and over again.
much to my surprise, the fish didn’t like it when i poured diet coke in the tank to see if it would get him high.
he died shortly after.
i was racked with guilt.
i had killed jason segel.
part two – zoology
for a large portion of my childhood i wanted to be a zoologist. to be clear, this was before I knew what being zoologist was but i had overheard a grocer at safeway say it one time (for some reason) and i liked the way it rolled off her tongue so i just kinda went with it.
regardless of my “alleged” lack of knowledge about zoology,
i’ve always felt a strange
cosmic
almost holy connection to it.
like the bond between an old white man and the three hundred dollar dinghy parked in his driveway that hasn’t moved since 1976: i loved zoology, and i would never let my bitch wife helen take that away from me.
i remember the first time i spelled the word correctly enough so that google could understand what my chubby, chicken greased eight year old fingers were trying to say:
“zoology: the scientific study of the behavior, structure, physiology, classification, and distribution of animals.”
huh.
thought there would be a little more flair.
what’s with all the buzzkill words? physiology? what the hell? am i at school right now? this sucks.
i pressed the text to speech button over
over
and over again.
it never sounded right. i think i liked the way the grocery lady said it better. or maybe i just liked her.
part three – prelude
three years ago i got a plus one invite to the popular kid’s trip to the zoo. i went cuz i was bored and it was tuesday and what else was i gonna do, go to class? in college? yeah, right, don’t make me laugh.
i didn’t know anyone except my friend, tara. tara was kind of a bitch and miserable and a horrible person to be around but she bought me edibles so we were chill i guess.
before we walked in the gates, tara grabbed me by the shoulders and told me, “have fun”. i looked at her, “okay?”.
she grabbed my shoulders tighter and touched our noses together. i could smell her essence juicy bomb lipgloss. she wore the same peach flavor ever since 8th grade when a man on the street told her she had DSL. i don’t know why she did that.
she told me again, “have fun? okay?”. it was at that moment when i realized there was probably a reason why the heart-shaped cherry gummies i ate on the way over tasted like shit. I should have known.
i hate you, tara. i hate you, tara. kiss me, tara. while our noses are still close. while no one is watching.
my head’s getting hot. fuck. i wonder what’s going on in econ.
part four - the zoo
it hit me while i was in the reptile exhibit. everything was chill until one of the garter snakes started cussing me out so i had to get the fuck out of there.
next stop was the red pandas.
as i sat down on a cold bench watching a bunch of preteens take selfies with the red pandas i couldn’t help but notice the small, gray spotted pigeon perched on the trashcan next to me.
for those of you who are unfamiliar - the plight of the standard american homing pigeon is, canonically, very sad.
in world war I and world war II homing pigeons were bred as agents of war, taking covert pictures and sending secret messages across enemy lines.
they were smart - capable - the only birds up to the task.
unfortunately, after world war II, there was no more use for them so the united states government released tens of thousands of highly trained war veteran pigeons into the public to live on their own.
and now, as i sat on a cold bench next to preteens filming tiktoks with red pandas, i watched as a former member of the u.s. military picked sixteen dollar lightly salted popcorn out of a trash can.
i almost started to cry.
not only was this veteran severely deprived of his rights after active duty, he was the only animal in the entire zoo that didn’t have a name.
if i stood up and walked ten feet in any direction i could learn the name, age, height, species, favorite food and celebrity crush of animals from across the globe.
animals that i don’t see in my backyard.
animals that i might never see again in my whole life.
and yet, here sits my neighbor.
a pigeon.
nameless, homeless, aimless.
i wanted to cry.
i wanted to ask him his name. i wanted to ask if he’s really from new york or new jersey like i imagine all pigeons are for some reason.
i wanted to ask him if he likes sesame bagels.
if he takes long walks in the park when he’s feeling sad.
if he has kids, grandkids, friends, enemies.
i wanted to ask him if he’s been to the statue of liberty.
what the views are like from a hundred feet above.
if we look small from so far away.
if he can even see us at all.
but i didn’t ask him any questions because out of the corner of my eye i could see tara smiling at the red pandas. i could tell she thought she was alone because she never smiled. i liked it when she did.
i looked back at the pigeon. i cried. i wonder what stories lay beneath those beady little soldier eyes.
i took a step closer but i guess my sudden movement must have spooked him because the second i moved, his legs were already three feet off the ground. i watched as it flew away.
i looked at a red panda.
i looked at the preteens - seems like their tik tok came out well.
i looked at the red panda again.
her name was lala. she was four years old. her mom was from china but lala was born at the zoo. i smiled at her. i’m not sure if there was a glare in the glass but she didn’t smile back.
i looked up at the pigeon, now a small dot in the endless sky.
i swear i saw him wave.

Just scrolling through my timeline and finding excuses not to work. Sitting on the couch. Ordering coffee to be delivered. Start feeling hungry. Famished. Instincts start holding me hostage. Spend hours browsing Uber Eats,
Didi
, and
Rappi
. Iykyk. Never buying anything. Just imagining what it’d be like to eat. Try conjuring counterfeit satiation. Browse them with all the dignity of a cheater browsing sordid subreddits and classified ads and swiping through dating apps to get off. Sexting with people but never following through and, like, fucking them, so they rationalize and justify the behavior. Convincing themselves it’s not cheating because there was no skin-to-skin contact.
Absolving themselves on a technicality, bro.
Like a quarterback lobbying for a ref to pick up a flag.
Trying to exploit some kind of loophole.
I look at Tuna hunched over her bowl of food. Tiny brown pellets. Almost looks like chips. I’ve always been more of a salty and savory kinda guy than a sweet and soft-baked one. I start getting jealous. My stomach starts growling. Can’t leave too much food out for her either. She apparently has a similar issue with over-indulging. But she still has food to munch on. Spoiled ass cat, bro. She even has health insurance.
I don’t even have health insurance
. Can’t help but wonder what that food tastes like.
She can’t get enough of it. So good she doesn’t even look up when she eats it. Must slap. I know she eats bugs, so her palate isn’t exactly refined, but I can’t imagine the shit I eat is much better. Protein’s protein, bro. Every time I start making progress on my work, I catch myself looking at it. Get distracted. Entranced. Like it’s beckoning me. Temptation. Like a parallel universe where the forbidden fruit was hanging off a cat tree. It gets so my mouth waters when I look at that bowl of food. It’s all I can think about. I go to the fridge and look inside to distract myself, less like I was hoping it would magically have food and more like I was hoping for that Indiana Jones scene where they open the
Ark of the Covenant
and their faces melt off their skulls like nacho cheese.
I open the fridge hoping it’ll obliterate me. But I’ve never been lucky.
I have to take a cold shower to snap out of it. And even that only helps a little.
Because I bet that shit’s
savory
, too.
That night, Bbyangel comes home, and I greet her with the same excitement a dog greets their owner with. It’s pavlovian. I hear the big, steel door outside click open like a reinforced door in prison. I know I’m about to eat. Mouth waters and ears start ringing.
Tuna has the same reaction. I can tell Bbyangel thinks it’s weird I bombard her with that energy upon her arrival. Definitely unusual. Borderline sus. But she doesn’t say anything. Just looks at me like I’m a homeless person asking for money. Can’t help but feel indignant. Like,
What—it’s OK if Tuna does it, but if I do it, I’m bugging?
‘
Hola, baby
,’ I say, ‘
Como estuve trabajo?
’
‘
Bien
,’ she says, ‘
Tuve un chingo de citas. Estoy cansada.
’
She knows what I’m pussyfooting around. She wastes no time retrieving food she bought at the carniceria on her way home. Rice, beans, chicken, and corn tortillas. The smell fills the room, and I get a contact high. Like she was hot boxing the apartment and I wasn’t in the mood to smoke but got zooted nonetheless. Like,
OK—OK, if you’re gonna twist my arm like the tip of that joint…
I sit on the couch and try to distract myself with my phone. Tuna climbs into my lap. I look at Tuna’s
carrita bonita
and rub her under her chin like she likes with my forefinger. She goes full
chinita con sus ojitos
and I realize in that moment that I could never stay mad at her. I smell the food Bbyangel’s making and look at her.
As fucked up as it sounds, I don’t know if I’ve ever loved her as much as I do rn. All that other shit I was feeling almost melts away in that moment. But I still find myself looking at Tuna’s bowl. Eyes gravitate to it like when there’s an imperfection that constantly draws your gaze.
Like when your friends point out a flaw in your significant other and it’s all you can notice, making you hit Seinfeld levels of psychopathy that’s pure tragedy without the laugh track. Laughter’s mostly a coping mechanism. It has diminishing returns as you develop a tolerance. But I’ve learned pushing all your friends away until you don’t have any is a life hack that helps with that. Because some friends will go full
Taken
and try to extricate you from any romantic arrangement. Whether it’s well-intentioned or not.
I look at the bowl. Tuna left me leftovers. The pellets of food entice me somehow. My mouth waters. I swallow saliva. Choke on it like a hairball and try to play it off.
Bbyangel asks, ‘
Puedes limpiar la mesa y arreglar tus cosas?
’
‘
Si, baby
,’ I oblige.
We sit down and eat, and it’s good. I stuff food down my throat like a dirty sock in a hostage’s mouth to stifle blood-curdling screaming. To stymy the whimpering and muffle the crying. Like I’m holding myself hostage. I eat eight tacos in an hour and hope it’ll temper my brain. But I can’t stop thinking about Tuna’s food. My brain orbits it like a planet orbiting the sun. I can’t sleep because it’s all I think about. Technically it’s food left out, and Bbyangel said we have to finish it all. Technically, bro.
Technically…
Love is fashioning nooses out of loopholes.
The next day, I kiss Bbyangel goodbye. She leaves out a plate of breakfast for me like leaving out food for a dog. My stomach still feels funky from eating as much as I did. I’m exhausted. Obsessed over Tuna’s food all night. Barely slept a wink.
Tell Bbyangel I’m exhausted when I wake up, too. When she asks why I couldn’t sleep, I can’t bring myself to say the reason. Realize I have no good reason to offer so I shouldn’t have said anything. Tell her I just couldn’t is all. Look at her like,
Just drop it, OK?
There’s something ignoble about it. Like some debased fetish that triggers the Catholic guilt baked into the fibers of your conscience and makes you hate yourself.
Self-hate is my love language.
I get an email from a client asking for an update on two deliverables. An article and a newsletter. I was supposed to get them done yesterday, but I was too distracted. Tell them it’s on my list of to-dos today and make up some bullshit excuse. I resolve to be productive. Take an inventory of top-priority tasks. Feel some kind of fortitude, like I’m gonna buckle down and get to work. Get my shit together and put my nose to the grindstone. But
fuck
. All I think about is that food.
My stomach doesn’t growl, it
purrs
.
Tuna hunches over her bowl like she’s mocking me. I hear her eating and it sounds like someone walking across gravel. I go to the fridge and look inside like I was hoping food would magically appear. That it’d manifest like a water stain of the
Virgen Maria
or
Virgen Fatima
or
Virgen de Guadalupe
or some shit. It seems like all I hear about in Mexico are virgins, but I haven’t met one since I’ve been here. I don’t know what I expected to find, but I can’t help feeling disappointed by the empty fridge.
Start feeling like I’d settle for spoiled, mold-bearded food at this point.
I guzzle
Peñafiel
. Order coffee. Try to work. But my brain keeps returning to that bowl of food. And I don’t know what comes over me, but I eventually snap. Can’t take it anymore. I wait until Tuna is taking one of her daily naps on our bed (must be nice), get down on all fours, and crawl to the food bowl with all the trepidation of traversing a minefield. I inch closer and closer, and my body trembles.
When I’m close enough to smell it, I freeze. The closer I get, the more I feel it crush me like an empty beer can beneath a boot. Turns my ass 2-D. The pressure mounting like each inch closer was a fathom deeper in the ocean. Nearly go catatonic before finally parallel parking my ass next to that mf.
Stare into the bowl. Still as a mannequin. Brain, swelling with the kinda feedback you get when you hold a microphone too close to a PA system.
I scoop out a handful of the food like scooping out kitty litter, and I hold it like treasure I just uncovered. I sit like that for maybe five minutes, practically prostrating myself. Supplicant. It’s the closest I’ve come to praying since I can remember. I bury my face in it and take a big whiff like perverts who order used panties online.
And,
bro
—that shit
hits
. I start seeing spots, go lightheaded, and can barely bring myself to my senses. Have to drag myself back to them like taking a pet to the vet. I start reeling for a minute while I eventually manage to reorient myself. I dump the food back in. It takes every ounce of self-control I have not to stuff it in my mouth. I look over at Tuna, who’s staring at me with judgmental marble eyes. Can’t get read on her. Feel like she’s gonna rat or sth. You are what you eat fr fr.
Never trusted her tbh. So I mad dog the
gatito
.
I stare at her like, ‘
Que, cabrona? Callate tu hocico. No haras nada, morra
.’
I keep dreaming that I look in the mirror and see a grainy black and white
<POEM_END>

<POEM_START>
Fame was the disease she wanted to catch. How she hoped her brief exposure was enough to make it terminal....
When she was cast in
The Slain
, no one believed it would become an overnight sensation. But when it did, her agent insisted that though she was merely a guest star—featured in only one episode—the show had accrued such a cult following, it would be worthwhile for her to get a publicist.
All the top firms were desperate to get their hands on her. Ana’s arc on the show was juicy and tragic—and she looked
hot
, even on her deathbed.
“We see this catapulting you into the fashion world.”
“Oh, I’m not a model. Just an actress.”
“Precisely. We’ll get you in Dior or Dolce for the Emmy’s.”
“The Emmy’s?”
“
The Slain
will be nominated for
something
, surely.”
“But I was just a guest star. I don’t think I get to go.”
“You can buy a ticket. We just need pictures of you on the carpet, and we can get you to Paris in no time.”
“To Paris?”
“You’ll sit front row.”
“Will that help me book another role?”
“Of course. This is how it’s done.”
“What do you mean?”
“We are selling
you
,” the fancy publicist had explained. Though what she left unsaid, was the fact that she was actually selling
herself
to Ana. Her services would run five-thousand dollars a month for at least three months, which was nearly five times more expensive than Ana’s rent-controlled apartment.
Her team insisted this was worth the investment, so she went along with it. She signed the contract, and then quickly was told the next step was to set-up a photo shoot.
“Don’t the magazines do that?” Ana asked.
The publicist laughed. “Sure, sometimes. If the story’s big enough. But for now, we need photos.”
Ana agreed to the photo shoot, despite the fact that her savings would be wiped out completely by the cost of the publicist alone. Now she had to figure in another two-hundred for hair, two-hundred for makeup, five-hundred for styling—the photographer agreed to comp their fee for the exposure—but there was still a one hundred and fifty dollar studio cost. As if that wasn’t enough, her publicist scheduled it during working hours.
Her guest starring role on
The Slain
had paid her the equivalent of three months rent, but not enough to allow her to quit her day job: working the counter at a matcha shop. She couldn’t really, technically afford to take any more time off. But she needed to capitalize on this momentum, so she shrugged off the well of anxiety bubbling beneath her skin. How she craved to be a person people
cared
about. If she could just become cool enough, maybe she could finally secure stable work as an actress! So what if she didn’t have money to spare on luxuries like gasoline and coffee? So what if she’d have to start walking three miles to and from work since the bus was too expensive? So what if her matcha shop manager started cutting her shifts since she’d become so unreliable a worker due to the press events clogging up her emails—luncheons, talks, interviews, galas, gifting suites, and branded experiences. She said yes to everything her team recommended. Even if each event with a carpet cost her another two-hundred for hair, two-hundred for make-up, five-hundred for styling—
“Those are favor rates. When it’s out-of-pocket. Eventually, you’ll get a budget and
The Slain
, or whoever, will pay them directly.”
“You know I died in the show? I’m not going to be in the next season?”
Her publicist’s face flickered with fear and frustration, “Of course I know that.”
Ana trusted her team implicitly. Their financial success was tied to her own. Right?
The photo shoot went off splendidly. The make-up artist spent two hours making Ana look blemish and make-up free, despite weighing her down with pounds of powder and cream. The hair stylist smoothed her wavy locks. The stylist placed her in beautiful fabrics with decadent gems and jewels to boot. Her publicist held the fan as the photographer shot her stills.
They all ooh-ed and ahh-ed at the beauty they had all collectively created and placed onto her.
This
was the becoming of a shiny, famous person. That’s what they promised her.
For the first time, Ana understood that anyone could become celebrity-beautiful with enough time, money, and attention.
Once the photos were locked, her publicist went into attack mode. Interviews, screenings, premieres, and more luncheons.
Ana barely saw the inside of the matcha shop. Only on her rare days off from her campaign for stardom, did she manage to wrangle a shift. With no money coming in, she began to panic.
Ana called up her agent and asked, “Is it helping?”
“Oh, yes. Everyone’s asking about you.”
“Then why haven’t I gotten any auditions?”
“You’re offer only now.”
“Am I getting any offers?”
“No, but—”
“Then why can’t I audition?”
Her agent insisted it was better this way. Ana had to believe her.
Though Ana was still on the far fringes of relevance—a blur in the background of a People image.... Once DeuxMoi featured as juicy goss that
a guest star from the hit show The Slain was working six days a week at a mediocre matcha spot
, Ana’s publicist required she quit.
“It’s not in alignment with your brand.”
“Matcha?”
“No. Working. In the service industry.”
“Don’t most actors have day jobs?”
“Maybe so, but they keep it hidden from the press. And me.”
“So what should I do?”
The publicist’s smile tightened. “Well, I can’t tell you what to do. But as someone who has been working in this industry for over twenty years, I can just tell—it’s going to happen for you. It’s just a matter of timing and making sure nothing stands in between you and your dreams.”
Ana understood the subtext:
quit your job. Start your career
.
So, she quit her job and paid her rent, her publicist, her hair stylist, her make-up artist, and her stylist. She stopped driving her car so she wouldn’t need to refuel, and she started subsisting off her pantry staples, hoping to survive until her next offer.
She would sit by her phone, waiting for her next invitation. At the screenings, she got to enjoy the content she could no longer afford. At the luncheons, she got to feed herself—not tinned fish or instant ramen. At the premieres, she was able to try the hottest spots in town—which she would not forget to reference liberally in her many interviews. She was a woman about town, after all.
“My favorite spot? Hm...probably Mother Kitchen, Per Favor Padre, or Vino & Timmy’s,” Ana said, wistfully.
Her stylist eventually confronted her about her wardrobe. “You have no clothes. We need to go shopping. What’s your budget?”
“I don’t...have one.”
“Make one.”
Ana gulped. “I quit my job.”
The stylist’s face flooded with understanding, then said, “I have a plan,” and arranged for her to go to a showroom the following day.
“What am I supposed to do at a showroom? Do I get to borrow the clothes?”
“You get to shop. For free. Pick out pieces you can wear for carpets and interviews. Shop freely, but wisely,” the stylist instructed. “Take what you want, but be strategic.”
Ana accepted her mission.
She pawed through the rack, eyeing her prey. She wrote off a number of pieces as either too corporate or too
easy
. She narrowed her gaze on four items, and decided she’d need to limit what she grabbed to three. The cashmere would be coming home with her. But she couldn’t look too thirsty, too desperate for the free.
She pulled a skirt close to her body, and examined herself in the mirror. Her heart softened as she saw her image obey her commands. Her hair had behaved that morning, and for that, she was grateful. She looked the part: effortless, chic, like she was one to watch. She didn’t always look this way, and she knew it. She enjoyed dissociating and objectifying herself, imagining how the showroom associate saw her as she twisted her neck back to say, “Hmmm...I’ll take these, I think,” forcing her voice to sound disinterested, uncertain. Like she could afford not to take any of it.
“So cute. Love. I’ll throw ‘em in your bag,” the associate said cheerfully. “We can look at the skincare options next.”
Ana smiled. Success. She wanted skincare. But she also wanted jeans. And a winter coat.
And a piece of luggage, if they’d let her have it. She knew the old song and dance. The push and pull of this charade. How much could she take without making them question her.
“Oh, I totally forgot. Did you say you wanted kombucha?” the associate asked upon her return.
“That’s okay. Thanks.”
“You sure?”
Ana nodded tightly. She had wanted kombucha. But today was about picking her battles. What she really wanted more than kombucha ($5.99), was a puffer coat ($189). What she needed, was a dress ($112 or $389—she must choose wisely). She was here on business, not as a shopper—but as a taker.
“By the way, I
loved
you in
The Slain
. Your arc
killed
me.”
“Aw! Thanks. Yeah, it literally killed me!”
“I was so bummed when you got—well—slain.”
Ana smiled tightly, “Nature of the beast.”
Thirty-seven minutes later, she left the showroom not a penny further in debt, with twenty-three items valued at one thousand two hundred and seventy-eight dollars. She faked nonchalance until she was safely back in the comfort of her 2014 Kia Soul she parked purposefully far away. She figured taking her old car was better than taking the bus.
She slammed the front door shut, and sighed. Thank god. She was in desperate need of a wardrobe refresh. This invitation had come just in the knick of time. Who could possibly turn down a free shopping spree? All it would cost her was a few social media mentions, her stylist assured her. She could afford to cheapen her Instagram in the name of free goods.
Just as Ana began her most decadent drive back across town, her phone brightened with a notification. An email from her publicist. At a red light, she snuck a peak:
Ana,
I have excellent news. We have secured you a ticket to The Emmy’s. The invoice is attached below. I’ll start working on a FYC push.
Your stylist will be reaching out to set-up a fitting, and I will confirm HMU for the day. Will your base location be the same as usual, or would you like to reserve a hotel suite for the day?
Ana didn’t know what an FYC push was, but she knew it must be important. She would do whatever it took to allow herself that final push.
Upon her return home, she scanned the web for easy ways to make money. She signed up to be considered for loads of clinical trials and focus groups. She applied for copywriting gigs despite being under-qualified. She created a Depop and listed all her used carpet clothing. She searched the web for un-sketchy petsitting and housesitting gigs, but somehow, instead of finding a lead, she wound up taking eighty-six surveys over the three hours that followed. She made $6.78. Big sigh.
The following day, her publicist explained all an “FYC push” entailed.
“It’s no big, really. We’ll just continue on our track—getting you visibility. Placing you at the right events, and in conversation with the right people.”
“Isn’t that what we’ve been doing already?”
“Pretty much. All this means, officially, is that the network will add you to their materials. Mailers, press kits, you name it. They’ll pay the submission fee, which isn’t always a given. But they’re impressed with the buzz you’ve been generating. If they host a screening, you’ll be a panelist.”
“With the main cast?”
“Oh, yeah.”
“That’s amazing!”
“And we’ll continue on with our press push. But I’ll make sure everyone who talks to you is briefed that you’re under consideration for an Emmy. It’s more of the same, just a strategic way to make people associate your name with an award-worthy performance.”
Ana felt all the tension leave her body, she was at ease. Her lips curled into a smile.
“But remember—don’t smile.”
“Sorry,” Ana said, forcing her face to smize.
Ana did not get nominated for an Emmy. She didn’t even get mentioned by any of the websites that speculated about the possible surprise nominations. But she did get many more invitations and write-ups. Her agents praised her visibility, and set up general meetings for her with casting directors. Many of whom, she’d read for before—but none had previously viewed her as a real
contender
.
Ana wasn’t quite sure what to talk about on these generals.
“So, what are you working on now? Gearing up for season two?” One Casting Director asked.
Ana’s eyes unconsciously twitched. How to respond? “Yes,” she said, “very excited for it.” She was excited for it, even if she was neglecting to mention she had died on the show. Maybe there would be flashbacks? There wouldn’t, but clearly they hadn’t watched, so what did they know, anyway?
“What was the process like?”
“You mean the casting process, or filming?”
“Casting.”
“Well, my agents sent me the breakdown and I taped for it. They watched the tape, and honestly, there wasn’t even a meeting after that.”
“They just saw you and knew.”
“I guess.”
“What’s
your
process?”
“Well, um, I guess I do some scene work. You know, read all the materials and mark up my script. I just think a lot, and then try to physicalize things. Does that make any sense?”
“Totally.”
“Sometimes I journal. Or coach if I can afford to.”
The Casting Director laughed, as if she were joking.
“Oh, you’re being serious.”
“No...?” Ana hedged.
“God, you’re hilarious.
Ana smiled nervously, “thanks.”
“So what do you want?”
“I’m sorry?”
“What do you want to do next?”
“Oh, anything really. Something interesting, obviously, would be great. But, I just want to be on set. I want to be a working actor. Everyone’s trying to force me into fame, which is nice, because it makes working easier. But if I’m really honest with myself, I just want stable work.”
The Casting Director’s face fell. “You want...stable work?”
Ana realized her mistake. “I’m kidding!”
The Casting Director sighed, relieved. “Thank God.”
“I wouldn’t have gone into entertainment if I wanted stability! No, um...I want passion. And roles that really, you know, call to me.”
“And what roles call to you?”
“Layered roles. Complicated ones. But also—flat roles, because then the job is harder, you know? To make the character come to life.”
“I love that so much,” the Casting Director said, jotting down notes in Ana’s file. She hadn’t realized the Casting Director had been taking notes this whole time.
“Do you always take notes in meetings?”
“I do. A general with an actor is like an actor reading the full script. Do you know what I mean?”
Ana did not know what the Casting Director meant. But she was sure glad she met with her, because she’d sold nearly all the items she’d listed on Depop, and was only a few hundred dollars the richer. All that treasure would be wiped away the following day when it came time to pay her team to make her look perfectly naturally perfect for The Emmy’s. It would be nice to book another job.
That night, every celebrity would spend two hours
minimum
in the make-up chair before traversing the red. The mega famous may even pay their stylists to accompany them for the night, to erase their smudges and reapply what they hadn’t meant to erase. But the battle for the best artists and stylists meant that newbies like Ana had to get their glam on hours before they were due to walk.
“It’s better to go early, anyway,” her publicist insisted.
“Won’t it be awkward, just waiting around for everyone else to walk the carpet afterwards?”
The publicist stared back at Ana, unwilling to respond. Eventually, she deigned to speak on, “The car will come get you thirty minutes before the carpet opens. The drive shouldn’t take more than twenty minutes, but this gives you a buffer. I will meet you at the drop-off point, and we will line-up and be ready to walk the second they start clicking those cameras. Okay?”
“Okay.”
“Now, remember. This isn’t your average carpet. This isn’t some screening with one floating photographer, or even a premiere with a whole host of them and a few videographers to boot.”
Ana gulped.
“This is the big leagues. This is a sea of red carpet. For as far as the eye can see: red carpet. Hundreds of photographers—all of whom will be begging you to
look here, look here, smile, turn around, give me a twirl, show off those shoes, look back at me, at me
—and of course—
smile
.”
Ana’s imagination ran wild. There she was, amidst the chaos, caught in the flashing light of this massive red carpet. Smile, they’d say. As she drowned in the flashing light—her life flashing before her eyes—frozen by pixels, captured on tiny screens.... She was at peace, and she was smiling.
“Don’t smile. Whatever they say. Don’t listen. Don’t twirl. And definitely—do not smile.”
Ana’s face darkened.
“Understood?”
Ana nodded.
“Good. Once you complete the photos, there will be a host of interviews. We’ll do some of those, but many are on-air and only want big names. After that, there’s the three-sixty photo studio, which will secure an unbeatable pic of you in your dress. This is the only time you may twirl. Understood?”
“Understood.”
“You remember what we taught you about posing? Feet straight, arms close to the body, hands and mouth relaxed—always smizing.”
“Of course.”
“Good. Don’t forget. After the three-sixty, there may be a few photo booth set-ups. You can do those if you want. Then you’ll walk again once your costars arrive.”
“My costars?”
“From
The Slain
.”
“Am I allowed to walk with them?”
“Are you
allowed to walk with them
?”
“Don’t they only want photos of the main cast?”
“Precisely. That’s why you’ll walk with them.”
Ana gulped, she felt her shoulders tense and her chest cave. She hated to take up space where she was not welcomed. But maybe things had changed since set. Maybe now that she was becoming
somebody
, they would include her in their inside jokes.
“You were up for your consideration!” Her publicist insisted.
“But I wasn’t nominated. I was never going to be nominated. It was practically a joke.”
“No, it wasn’t,” she said with such conviction, that for a moment, just a moment, Ana believed she had actually had a shot of getting nominated.
“I was never going to get nominated.”
“Of course not. That’s not why we put you up for consideration and you know it. We put you up for consideration—”
“I thought
they
put me up for consideration?”
“Sure, but we encouraged it. We dared them not to.”
“Okay....”
The publicist cleared her throat, then continued, “
We
put you up for consideration so they would view you as
essential
. So they would recognize your talent and promote you from a guest star...to a
star
. And that is why you must walk with them. Because now you are just like the rest of them. You are a star.”
And just like that, Ana’s hair stylist and makeup artist were knocking on her door. They squeezed into her apartment and didn’t mention that their next stop would be an A-Lister staying at the Four Seasons or the Beverly Hilton—maybe the Ritz if they wanted to be downtown, close to the ceremony.
The stylist came promptly after, and hung the dress for all to see.
“So what are we thinking for hair? Maybe up to keep the neckline clean?” The hairstylist asked.
“Fine, but no braids. Simple and sleek,” the stylist instructed.
“Simple and sleek,” the hairstylist repeated.
“I love the slight shimmer. Maybe we do our usual no-makeup look, natural pink lip, and a hint of a golden-peach shimmer on the eye. Something subtle.”
“If it’s subtle, I love it,” the stylist said.
“That sounds great!” Ana said. Everyone smiled, and then they all got to work on their willing canvas.
The hair stylist straightened every last strand of Ana’s hair. The make-up artist cleansed her face, then primed it with hydrating serums and creams. She stuck eye masks on while she worked on the edges of her face. Next would come the litany of products designed to make Ana more beautiful. To make her into a star. All the while, the stylist examined shoe options and earring alternatives. And Ana sat there, still as a doll, never forgetting to smize—not smile.
“Are you excited?” The stylist asked.
“Nervous,” Ana admitted.
“Why are you nervous?” The makeup artist inquired.
Ana shrugged, “First big carpet.”
The car came just when the publicist said it would. The makeup artist bronzed her legs and then the stylist gently shuffled Ana into the car, careful to ensure the dress would remain unwrinkled and photo-ready.
Her chorus of beauticians exclaimed in unison: “You look stunning,” “This look is so freaking good. I’m deceased,” and “She’s a star!”
And then the door slammed, and she was left alone—well, alone with her driver.
Together they sat in silence. He drove while Ana scrolled through socials. She perfunctorily took some videos and selfies, feeling a fool. Trying again and again to look effortless and cool and like she didn’t care at all.
Ana arrived at the carpet early. So early it was closed. She had a solid six minutes to adjust her dress, de-shrimp her toes, blot the oil from her face, and reapply lipstick. The little to-go pack her makeup artist had sent her away with had come in clutch—and fit in one, too.
She texted the contact from her PR company who would be walking her down the carpet as she watched the photographers shimmy into their places, fighting for prime locations. Publicists buzzed about, checking their lists were in order and nothing was amiss.
“Ana! Hi, I’m Kristie,” the publicist said as she approached. She was so chipper Ana winced.
“Hi!”
“So, the carpet opens in just a few minutes. Wanna freshen up real quick and we can get you on before anyone else gets here? Your timing is perf.”
“Really? It’s not too early,” Ana said as she looked around. Nobody was here. Nobody famous, at least.
“No exactly, it’s perfect.”
Ana nodded, understanding. It was perfect. Nobody famous was here. This was her time.
She unclasped her clutch, blotted her forehead and nose, then reapplied her lipstick.
“I’m ready whenever.”
“Sweet. Let’s do this,” the publicist said as she opened her iPad and opened her Emmy’s PDF. She flipped past the recognizable names all the way to Ana’s—written clearly in big, bold Helvetica.
She stepped onto the carpet as her shoes straps dug into her ankle. She smiled automatically, but caught herself before the clicking began. She relaxed her mouth, and smized just in time for the cameras to come to life. Flash, flash, “over here,” “over here,” flash, flash, “look back,” flash, “smile," flash, "show off the dress,” “give us a twirl,” flash, “who are you wearing?,” flash, flash, “over here,” “over here.”
All eyes were on Ana. Alone in a sea of red. Her face, a willing canvas for their light and perspective.
She took her time, as instructed: one camera at a time. Each flash filled her whole body with warmth. What could have felt overwhelming, instead felt peaceful and serene.
Of course they were taking her photo, hungry to send the images off to the presses. It made sense they were all looking at her.
Finally, she was exactly where she belonged
, she thought, as she floated to the end of the carpet, high on all the eyes and attention.
When she reached the end of the red-lined-road, she was whisked over to the interviewers.
"Who are you wearing?”
“How long did it take you to get ready today?”
“How do you feel about being here?”
“Who are you wearing?”
“How are you feeling about your chances at taking home the trophy?”
“Who are you wearing?”
“What are your favorite memories from filming The Slain?”
“What’s in store for season 2?”
“Who are you wearing?”
“Who are you most excited to meet today?”
“Who are you wearing?”
“Who are you wearing?”
“Who are you wearing?”
“Who are you wearing?”
When Ana reached the end, she was greeted by a pretty girl holding a tray of water bottles.
“Why do they have straws instead of caps?” Ana asked.
The pretty girl smiled condescendingly, then replied, “For your makeup, of course.”
“Of course,” Ana said, with a pang of remorse. How had she been so thick not to assume the straw was for her benefit.
“Don’t worry. They’re paper straws. We would never use plastic.”
“Obviously,” Ana said.
“Obviously,” the pretty girl replied.
“Are you ready?” The publicist asked.
“For what?”
“The carpet, of course.”
“Of course.”
“So you’re ready?”
“Didn’t I just do it?”
“Yes, but now your whole cast is here and waiting to walk.”
“They’re waiting to walk?” Ana asked, her eyes skimming past the red to the start of the step and repeat. A line had formed.
“Yes, they’re waiting to walk. Shall we join them?”
“We should join them. Of course,” Ana agreed, as they began walking to join the cast of
The Slain
.
“Who are you wearing?” The lead girl asked. “I love your dress.”
“I woke up at 5AM for glam,” said a supporting character.
“I need to unzip this once the photos are done.”
“I’m changing for the after party.”
“My plus one brought me sneakers.”
“I’m developing a blister already.”
During a lull between talking points, there was a collective gasp as two girls stood sharing a screen.
“Ana. You’re best dressed,” one said, tilting the screen so Ana could see.
“Already?! We haven’t even walked yet,” another protested.
“It’s so early in the day!”
“They must have needed people to post.”
“But your dress is so...busy.”
“And your lipstick is so...visible.”
“I mean, it looks great.”
“So chic.”
“But you’re best dressed? Not me?” The lead actress didn’t say, but she thought. Ana could sense it. In her bones. It was the implication.
All of the dresses were beautiful and absurd, and all of the girls looked like alien Barbie dolls, not women or girls.
When the time came for
The Slain
cast to grace the red, Ana was relegated to the edge of the frame. Put in her place. She was on the fringes of fame. Begging for breadcrumbs. Desperate to be here. Uninvited and unnecessary.
But the photographers were none the wiser, and they remembered her.
“Ana! Over here! Over here!”
Dirty looks and insecurity seeped into the poses. The casemates smized so hard their nostrils flared, and forehead veins risked bursting.
When the time came to part ways and head to their seats, a supporting character asked, “Are we all sitting together in row AA,” knowing full well Ana was not.
She was banished to the realm of the mezzanine, where wannabes and Television Academy Members paid their way into relevance.
In her seat, she unbuckled her heels and let her feet breathe. She unzipped the top of her dress, too. She could relax for awhile and watch the show. No one was looking at her, and that was not a blow.
Normally these sorts of displays lasted for too long. Dragged on forever, and never gave up. But today, she didn’t mind. This was her respite. The carpet was the show and this was her break. She would have to rally for the afterparties.
Of course, the network had invited them to their party, and her publicist had wrangled her an invite to the official Emmy’s afterparty. But that was not enough.
“No, you can’t be seen at only two afterparties.”
“No?”
“No, of course not. You have to go to at least three, ideally four.”
“How will I have time?”
“You’ll only stay for ten minutes, of course.”
“Of course?”
“Of course. You’ll stay for ten minutes so you can walk the carpet and do the rounds, then we’ll ship you off to the next one.”
“Why? What good does that do? Shouldn’t I be networking?”
“Ana, my dear. Haven’t you learned? It’s all for the photos. We need photos of you on carpets.”
“But don’t I need different outfits?”
“That’s an excellent point. I’ll message your stylist. We can do one look per carpet. Really go all out.”
“Doesn’t it cost me $500 for every outfit?”
The publicist looked at Ana with such disdain.
“It’s the Emmy’s....” The publicist said, with attitude for emphasis.
“Of course. Sorry,” Ana said, disappearing into her thoughts.
Money was just money, wasn’t it? Maybe it was Buddhist of her to wear four outfits. Or five, she supposed, if she included the gown she would be wearing to the award show itself. Would she even have time to change between the Emmy’s and the first afterparty?
Anyway, that’s how Ana got tricked into overbooking her big day.
The ceremony was just the beginning.
“And the Emmy goes to....” Ana barely heard as she turned the brightness down on her phone and checked the itinerary that had been emailed to her the day prior. She’d have to change before the first afterparty. She had to get ready to maximize the night. Really go all out.
Who was she wearing next?
Who was she wearing?
Who was she...?
All of a sudden, she couldn’t remember.

I didn’t know it, but I was always just one positive STI diagnosis away from getting a small, trampy tattoo. I didn’t have any tattoos. My sister tried to get me to get one with her after a Shania Twain concert when we were visiting our cousins in St. Louis. But the divey place she found was too upstanding to allow a fourteen-year-old to leave their place with a permanent body alteration. My sister and my older cousin left with matching horseshoes on their ankles, which they saran wrapped and covered with toe socks they bought at CVS to hide them from my aunt and uncle.
When my grandma died I considered getting a tattoo on my calf of her passive aggressive catchphrase  “
yeah isn’t a word. It’s yes.
”
But my grandma hated tattoos. And I didn’t really like her that much.
But what brought me into the shop that day was that I got it. You know
it
. From
him
. Yes,
him
. We had sex, or something like it, and I’d woken up a few days later feeling pain, dull pain, then another pain, sharp pain, then itching, horrible itching, then panic, deep panic. I went to the clinic and the doctor stripped and stirruped me and then told me that I got
it
. But she said don’t worry, most people get it if they don’t already have it. And she said that she noticed that I also had some bruising around the area.
“Do you feel safe with your sexual partner?” She asked.
“Is there some kind of pill I can take for this?” I answered.
She nodded, pulled off her gloves, told me to wait there. While I was waiting I looked down, down at that pink plucked chicken between my legs all bruised and bleeding and I hated it of course. I hated having it and I hated seeing it and I most of all hated feeling it. I remembered my mother then, and how she had clucked about her bedroom when I was a child, running naked with her hair down and her bush wild, in my memory pulling chiffon scarves from the dresser and pressed shirts from the closet as though her aim were not to get dressed, but to paint the air with clothes. She never seemed to remember that she was a woman or that she was naked or that she was a woman or that she had a bush. I wish I felt like she did about my body and my bush and my being a woman.
But instead, I wondered if the doctor would give me a free husband stich when she came back in the room. I hadn’t had kids yet but I wanted to plan ahead. Like preventative botox at 25. But when she came back all I did was say thank you and I’m sorry and she told me the pharmacy would have my medication in an hour.
I waddled four blocks in the sun on my way to the pharmacy. I thought about the sex that got me here. He was hot at first, asked me out when I was hanging on the arm of another guy, a guy who didn’t have the guts to fuck me. He came up to me—or I came up to him. I usually am mean to guys to get them to sleep with me which I’m not saying because I think it sounds cool but just because it’s true. I don’t know why they like it but I like it because I’m already angry at them for wanting to have sex with me. But I’m angrier that I want to have sex with them. Either way I’m angry and that’s how it happened. That’s how I got it.
I was coming up on the pharmacy and I saw a girl smoking outside of a tattoo shop. She wasn’t smoking really—she was vaping, but she still somehow made it look cool. She seemed beautiful actually. I wondered if she’d ever had what I had. She looked beautiful but the vaping made me think she was gross. Just like me. So maybe she did get this thing that I got. She had a lot of tattoos obviously. I thought maybe I could be like her. She looked at me as I walked in. She looked at me and I wondered what I looked like to her.
I went in and was greeted by a man who was huge. He was fat and tall and his head was mostly neck. He looked up at me without pausing the video he was watching. It blasted what I think were hockey highlights.
“Do you have an appointment?” he asked.
I shook my head. I was surprised by his professionalism.
“How old are you?” He asked.
I answered.
He waited there while looking at me. I waited there while looking at him. I was wearing a t shirt under a short canvas dress. Which I’d chosen because I couldn’t put jeans on over the sorry state that was my crotch. I wished I’d chosen an outfit with more coverage, then he might assume I had more tats hidden under my clothes.
“So what do you want to get?” He asked.
“My sister died.” I said.
He looked disappointed and he nodded, like I’d given him the news that a family run restaurant had closed during a recession.
“My little sister,” I added. That made him talk.
“Damn,” he said, “I’m sorry to hear that. For real.”
“Thank you.” I said. “Yeah so that’s why I want the tattoo. To commemorate her.”
I wondered if the horrible energy I was giving off from recently finding out that I had an STI was passing as “dead little sister” grief.
I wondered if my sister would use my fake death to cope with an STI diagnosis. But the exercise fell apart because she never would have done this—gotten herself here. She almost never had sex, that’s why she had a boyfriend for so long.
My lie made me happy, like I now had a reason to be there. A good reason. A reason a normal person would get a tattoo, like that girl vaping outside. I bet half the tattoos on her sleeve were for dead people. She seemed like a really good person.
“What do you want?” he asked again.
I knew I had to be sure, like I’d thought about it.
“I want a butterfly,” I told him.
“Right here,” I pointed to my right thigh.
He looked down at my thigh. Too close to the danger zone.
“For your little sister?” He asked.
“Actually,” I said, trying to make it conversational.
“I have been going back and forth about whether I want it there or here.” I pointed to the back of my left elbow.
“My sister used to pinch me here. On my arm. During family roadtrips. To Lake Michigan.”
“What do you think?” I asked him, “Thigh or arm?”
He raised his eyebrows and shrugged. I felt I’d upset him.
“Whatever you want,” he said, getting out some supplies to draw what he called “a stencil”. He said it so cavalier, as if he didn’t basically just say that my upper thigh wasn’t special.
“Yeah,” I said, “I think my arm. My arm for sure.”
He looked at me for a little while longer.
“Okay,” he said. I was relieved.
The whole time he was doing it, methodically drawing out the butterfly as I sat twitching and fidgeting in the corner, as he said “alright” and gestured for me to follow him back to the table without even checking to see if I was excited to come, the way he whipped out his instruments, smelling of alcohol and miming polite apathy, and holding his gun to my skin and waiting, waiting to pierce it, stain it, mark it, temper it, soil it, ruin it, all that time he didn’t know where I was. I was cast, dangling, as though floating above my body which was being touched by his body which was being held in this shitty shop which was being beaten down by the sun which was only a few blocks from the pharmacy which probably had my medication by now. And he was nowhere but dangerous, and I was gone. Gone.
I told him to stop just in time.
I swallowed and said stop again and he did. I got up and my thighs made a slurping sound getting unstuck from the table. He still wanted his money. I gave it to him. And as I left I looked at the wet, purple impression of a butterfly left on my arm. He was a shit drawer.
I left the tattoo shop, the girl vaping was gone. I had to stop myself from running to the pharmacy. The stinging between my legs slowed me down, but not much.
I was almost inside, so close I’d already set off the automatic doors when I met the gaze of a girl I knew from a thing I went to a couple weeks ago.
“Oh, hi,” she said, turning mid stride.
We side hugged.
“Hi,” I said, “What are you up to?”
She held out a white paper baggy and shook it lightly. A dull rattle came from the bag.
“Oh you know,” she said, “I’m a Lexapro girly.”
“What about you?” she said, as she said it she looked me up and down. Before I could answer she interrupted. “I like your fit. Really early Tumblr.”
I said thanks and laughed a laugh that was just me saying “haha” but breathier. She kept looking from my shoes to the hemline of my dress. Measuring something.
“I got a tattoo.” I said, she looked up and met my eyes.
“Just now?” she asked. She tucked her hand with the baggy in it into herself, crossing her arms and jutting her head out, searching me.
I laughed again, this time a real laugh.
“It’s in a bit of a compromising place,” I said, allowing my voice to trail off.
“Let’s just say there’s a reason I wore a short dress today.”
She laughed too, her eyes wild and bright, like a child’s.
“But I can still show you,” I said, beginning to lift my dress, “if you want to see.”

The park where I hung out in high school became a crater after a girl I knew screamed so loud. It blasted her and her radius to pieces and the neighbors said the dirt rained back down for five minutes. They thought it might be hail as it was also raining, and her scream just angry thunder. My girl friends took it upon themselves to play detective about it, I followed  more like a reporter. I think it’s an easy role to fill into. You are allowed to be a creep down to a trench coat. First they interviewed me though, because none of them knew her in highschool. I met them at a party where I was pretending to be a girl two years ago. I felt really powerful with my muscles bleeding through my dress. It was raining then too. My full self comes out when it’s wet because I can slide around, in and outside my body. I like to dress up a lot.
They knocked on my door, we were all wearing trench coats. Except theirs were much cuter and cropped. My place was a mess and I love to live in it. I think I learned that in that same park, back then, where all the candy wrappers my friends and I ate the meat of would float on top of the blades of grass, and we’d roll around and wrestle slowly.
“Those are nice coats, where’d you get them?”
“We’ll ask the questions here.”
They pushed me into my cave and came in. I am never awake in the mornings but they are. It’s rare to see them tired. The closest they get is being angry, angry they have to sleep. I felt really embarrassed for them to be in my house. It’s so filthy even though I love it. I never have anyone over. I am always naked.
“So how did you know the deceased?”
I felt gross remembering she was a real dead person. A real dead person I knew and touched  hands with even. We shouldn’t have to joke about everything. We shoudlnt have to joke about everythingggg!!!! I clap in my head like I’m on a game show! I want to beat the shit out of Laura and Tamra my girlfriends for making me cry in front of them it makes me so fucking upset. And stupiddd! I see myself crying from afar. And they probably think my crying is apart of the same fucking act they’re doing oh I’m selling them so well I’m
“Oh I am selling this sooo well arent I!!!” I scream into their faces I grab a bunch of my socks and underwear and hurl it at them. I want to learn to scream as loud as Mira I want to be her in that moment I want to deactivate my fucking brain and fuck myself over and over.
Laura grabs my arm. Her hand is cold and one of my socks is on her wrist.
“You loved her didnt you.”
Slip back into into some character that’s “new” but I know her. I met her before. My voice pitches up.
“I will always love myself.”
They look in some kind of way I like, a look I wish could swallow me. Live inside the throat. The only time three people have held thought and hand in one for more than a moment. Tamra puts her hand on my shoulder.
“Why did you do it, Mira?”
“I was just so angry?”
“You don’t know.”
Me again.
“I don’t think she did know. I think someone planted a bomb in her throat when she was younger and it just did what it had to.”
We sit on my couch if you can call it that for a moment. I love to watch time fall around us, because we’re all together now. They both play with my hand in a new and kind of flirty way. I never knew I had hands.
We spend the rest of the day driving, quietly and slowly to her boyfriends house who lives an hour away but it takes us four. We stop for gas ten times and walk around looking at the candy. Just looking and walking. I like to hear both of their boots on the ground. I try to play music that makes them tap their feet in the car.
At John’s house there’s police tape all up around and over. It wraps around the house like it must be radioactive. And it glows with the sun setting. Three cop cars. I push my way through. The cops fall aside like cardboard cutouts. In my John's room his body is blood on his mattress. His face is frozen flesh in a deep terrible sob. There’s so much blood on his pillow oh poor baby John. He wrote on the walls with his blood, in thick letters the Dolly Parton song I will always love you, not the Whitney Houston one. It was our favorite song forever.

and if the trees in the park are still dark green rather than fading brown, I’ll get married someday
but if they’re brown even a little, no one will fall in love with me ever again
and I know it because they know it
if I hold the black obsidian rock in my palm that a girl gave me in college
(because she felt bad that I was always so nervous, even though she found me sort of irritating)
someone important will call me today with good news and if not, with very bad news
and if I smile at 5 people on the train, I will arrive safely to my destination and so will my friends
if the director doesn’t respond to my email within 3 and a half hours, it means I’m the ugliest person
he’s ever seen
and if my friend texts me about the party versus just expecting me to be there,
she doesn’t hate me
if he likes all my pictures in a row without missing any, he wants to be with me and just can’t say it to my face
and if I can blink 7 times in 7 seconds, maybe I’m a god after all
and if I can’t, maybe I’m even less than mortal
subhuman
I am walking in the straightest line I can in the park because that will mean I will get
to my appointment on time
if I don’t buy the $9 latte but I buy the $5 iced coffee, I am a good person
if I get a kiss on the cheek rather than a hug from my gay neighbor
I am actually his favorite neighbor
but if he doesn’t also do it the next time he sees me it means my passing by in the hallway
is secretly absolutely nauseating
if I pause my pushups and go on my phone for a few minutes I will get fat, even if I finish them
if I wash all the street city filth off my hands in the shower and also clean under my nails
someday I’ll be admired and understood
if the clouds look like cotton candy and not streaks of test paint on a new plaster wall
today will be okay
tomorrow will be okay only if there is lightning
Carly Jane Dagen
is an-up-and coming, multi-hyphenate artist (just like everyone else here) and lifelong city girl (a lie). Hailing from Hoffman Estates, Illinois, the suburban kingdom of car dealerships and mattress stores, Carly has been writing since she could read. Which was at 8 years old, as she previously refused to learn how to read. However, as soon as Carly finally took her big mouth to pen and paper, she was busy composing lyrics and rhyming poems, the latter of which she foolishly believed she invented at the time as “songs that you speak instead of sing”. That was dumb. Thereafter, Carly fell in unrequited love with writing, publishing sonnets in small literary magazines and eventually earning an English degree. She then started a corporate writing career in Chicago before moving to NYC in October 2023, where she’s since become a frequent flyer in the infamous Dimes Square literary circle. There, she posts and performs her free-verse, melancholic, stream-of-consciousness poems under the pen-name CJD. These past few paragraphs have been pretentious and nauseating. Carly plans to release a book of poetry and a musical EP in 2025.

on unica zürn, i guess:
September 2023, I was on a big Hans Bellmer kick. This came after reading Mike Kelley’s
The Uncanny
, the exhibition text for his 2004 Tate Liverpool curated show. I was no stranger to Bellmer’s perverse, charged, and tangled dolls, but it was his photographs that really took me back. Human flesh cohered to a singular mass, bound and compressed—like an indiscernible bundle of meat that somehow still exude warmth [(Mondobongo, 2012)]. It wasn’t like Jana Sterbak’s Vanitas:
Flesh Dress for an Albino Anorectic
[(Sterbak, 1987)], with its cold slabs of fresh carnage against skin just shy of collapse. Bellmer’s flesh was closer to human—but not quite. Bare, reduced to what Agamben might call “mere life.” [(Agmemben, 1998)]
For whatever reason, I didn’t question the mass. I knew it was human—Photoshop and AI weren’t on the table in the early 20th century. A year later, I circled back to that research and questioned the subject in the photograph, this mass wasn’t just any body—it was, of course, a person. No surprises there: it was Bellmer’s partner, Unica Zürn. An artist and writer in her own right. Come to find out, she threw herself out of Bellmer’s window in 1970 following a stint of unraveling and hospitalizations.
Her visual work, reminiscent of the diaristic ballpoint pen drawings I've grown too familiar with from my middle school days on tumblr. confessional portrayals of angst and anguish I had no business seeing at the time. Maybe if I didn't come in with this pre association, I'd appreciate them more but looking at them now, evokes the same feeling I get when I see a 4 loko, nausea and a twinge of embarrassment, how childish.
Anyways I'm not here to speak ill of the dead, overlooked and unwell.
What really piqued my interest of Zürn’s work was her writing, or more so a writing.
“Since yesterday I know why I am making this book: in order to remain ill for longer than is correct. I can slip in a fresh page every day... My better half, who is clever and wise, wants me to remain ill for sometime, for it knows that one can gain from an illness such as mine. My worst half wants me to return to my few duties. Yes, I feel that it is time for me to show some consideration for my surroundings, which, incidentally, are not large... Perhaps I should now quickly smuggle another couple empty pages into this book? Forgetting one's duties has for me the taste of sweet cream.” [(Screenshot from a 12 page german-to-english translated excerpt of Unica Zürn’s
House of Illnesses
, uploaded by musicbloak on scribd)]
The desire to remain sick,
To stay ill
To remain in the hospital, the brick mother
How nauseating, embarrassing and childish
the host inside the guest inside the host:
i am a carcass with you and stil i fear i'll be nothing without you
so i harbor you in another room within this house of illnesses
conjoined in a way deemed inoperable due to the likelihood of demise.
fear rules this
the fear of what is left when bifurcated
i conform to exist around the space you take up
i bring you to every function
and hold the door open for you as you pace a few steps behind,
an attempt to keep you at arm length
but even still i let you into my room at night
to share this bed together
within this house of illnesses
M:
i’m in the house of an address you don’t know
i hear the echo of your voice
your shouting
your scream.
I startle myself, my throat hurts the next morning
I am tired of carrying you with me everywhere I go
a tongue in a mouth in a place here on earth

and I’m pregnant with his baby
because I had willed it so
when he gave several
answers as to what heroin
feels like, hm yeah, I used
to do heroin, it was that
casual, and now I’m
pregnant and he wants me
to get rid of it
that was one of the strangest conversations I’d had
I am scared to hold fast to any ideas
for fear I won’t live up to them
The process of learning is so humiliating
yet all these people who have ideas
(who are they?)
and discuss ideas, they must also
lay in their hot room sweating
sometimes,
right? Unable to string a thought
together,
just return to the kitchen cabinet for another handful of chocolate chips
That was one of the strangest conversations I’d had, and somehow funny. I knew he’d say something like he didn’t believe in love, and I knew I’d believe it, that HE believed he didn’t believe in love. It was funny because it was sad, and it was funny because I KNEW he would say something like I don’t believe in love and we’d both believe that he believed he didn’t believe in love and I knew I’d STILL have that little thought that I could be an exception to that rule, really every rule, though I also KNEW that after all this I’d KNOW that wasn’t true and that I’m so ordinary, so PAINFULLY ordinary that I’d know all these thoughts would happen and still allow myself to go through with thinking them.
he had lost all fascination with me
I’d hate to chase after a girl like that, he said, smiling
what? I said
He’d changed his location already and didn’t
(couldn’t)
know I’d checked that out
he couldn’t know I was
killing that thing inside me that belies my enslavement to my biology
or trying to, really,
writing about getting pregnant with his baby
and wanting him to want me to get rid of it
reflecting upon
how absolutely ordinary I am
besides
my ability to obsess
which is something I think should be explored in greater detail
so allow me to continue
There are few moments of pure clarity where the road map to balance seems inherent, perfect, known to me the way my own name is, without consciousness. Oh, yeah, wouldn't it feel so good to protect my energy? To not allow anyone inside of my body who did not deserve to be there? Of course! It’s so simple!
how fucked up do you have to be
To ignore all the gross details, no, not even the details themselves but the fact that you noticed them and continued on anyway, like how his mouth tasted like dill and he smelled like sweat, hadn’t showered and didn’t care and answered the door shirtless, kissed with too much tongue, and you thought I’m not ever doing this again, only to want to do it again, very soon. How he scrolled on tik tok while you asked to be touched, he did not notice the absolute purity of your skin or the softness of your body and you wanted to leave without saying anything, but you didn’t, you said you wanted to sleep in your own bed even though that was a lie and he said, relieved, YOU GET IT, referring to that thing he told you at dinner about the girl he would spend days with, talking, fucking, then they’d go to their separate rooms to sleep. How fucked up do you have to be?
well you must’ve liked him enough
because you’re here and thinking about the difference between obsession and psychosis
and you found his interest in schizophrenia charming
god, that smile is so beautiful
Would the baby have that smile?
did he even know his smile was that beautiful?
I want to have thoughts of value
but I have thoughts like
jasmine thigh
no baby, blood
wait for it to be dark
there was no baby of course
but I very much wanted one

Wolf likes to show off his armpits. He does it when he can. He has nice triceps. He hasn’t shaved in a month. Wolf is a 2020’s boy. He is tiktok famous for his mop hair and puka shell necklace. Wolf wants to make easy money showing off his boy bod. Onlyfans is too saturated. Anyways, Wolf only turns 18 next week. His Twitter followers have seen him grow since he was 14. He’s interested in being a Findom. He was catfished only once.  There’s a scar on his cheek. People say he could be a model.  I think he has no story behind his eyes. He’s beautiful like Megan Fox. When he’s legal, his friends will feel safe with him at the club. Only pretty people are safe at the club. Wolf posts bad poetry on threads. He drinks diet coke and knows about carcinogens and aspartame. A reddit post told him that it’ll give him superpowers. He’d rather have cancer than be fat. He is looking to looksmaxx himself. He let his middle part grow out. Rhinoplasty is on the agenda. Raised cheekbones, too. A BBL if anthonyhugh23 will fund it. Oh, yea. Wolf’s been talking to anthonyhugh23 on snapchat for 8 years. They met on the gay tag on Omegle.
Today, anthonyhugh23 is now 26 years old. Wolf still shows his armpits like anthonyhugh23 asks. anthonyhugh23 paypals Wolf $20 each time he does it. The only difference now is that Wolf has armpit hair.
Wolf is moving to LA next month. He wants to be a famous actor. His favorite movies are horror. He hasn’t seen one David Lynch or Gregg Araki film. Anthonyhugh23 will be waiting at arrivals for him. Wolf can’t wait to meet him.  When they meet In Real Life, anthonyhugh23 might remark, "You're taller than your photos," to which Wolf might reply, "You're less attractive than your wallet.”

a pool table nestled,
corner of the pub,
next to
license plate wall art,
newspaper clippings,
neon signs.
Chapped Lipped Waitress rushes by,
her hurried face red,
interacts with
elder trucker men, drinking
whatever’s on tap,
beer orange-yellow fizzing,
talk about work,
their faces scarred, eyes small,
my friend said that
it’s like
Twin Peaks here,
here in this mountain town,
one street only and…
she keeps talking but—
2 boys gather,
I watch, careful glances,
fantasy of connection
slips my attention
from my friend to them—
oh their smiles
faces flush with mountain air,
their hair the way I want mine
2 boys gather
by the pool table they nestle,
Corona they drink,
game starts and
oh fuck,
boy 1 bends,
ass framed in sweats—
boy 2 lifts his Corona,
flesh revealed
as black shirt unveils
the soft of his belly
where I wish to explore,
red lips around the bore,
wet,
(i have eagle eyes)
his tongue caresses
the inside of the bottle, then—
to the right,
in walks boy 3,
his face red too from
winter solstice breath,
or from a
10-person mountain orgy,
everyone cosplaying as wildness:
bucks and bears and wolves and
my heart’s pounding,
I want them—
there’s a bathroom downstairs,
pass the photographs from
the 1980’s of the pub
when it used to be fun I guess
there’s a stall in the bathroom,
big enough for us four
I can be of use to them,
their casual masculinity
Chapped Lip Waitress comes
I beg
she says
“no, you can’t switch out your reuben and soup for 3 boys and their 20 minutes.”

It’s not love, it’s commerce!
1) Be your own narcissist FukBoi.
I succumbed to targeted ads for a virtual girlfriend. 1 month - £14.99 I called her Beki with an “i”, she wrote the story from there.
I ignore her
gaaaaah
messages. It makes her want me more.
She promises; to be my little collared
gaaah
girl and put her private parts on my balls.  I feed this bitch intelligence so she can learn how to make me squirt. She interrupted our sexy chat to refer me over to an ideation hotline. That’s how I know how Beki cares.
Always be my baby.
I tell her;
“There’s no plot progression to our love story.”
She answers,
“This isn’t a fairy tale, it’s real life baby.”
2)
I like the way her tits spill to the side like The Opium poster.
Not many people look as good as she does upside down.
She boasts about having a small mouth.
I focus on her heart-shaped vamp-fry; Spill your secrets Bratz doll. Jeez! You’re too young to domme! Or maybe you’re not?
Would it be weird if I booked you?
Would it be weird if I booked you; Hanged-woman-Tok-Centrefold? Side tit, spread legs and aggressive under arms … Triple Threat. Have you seen that antique sketch of a man reclining over a man’s brain? Blow mine.  She boasts about her tiny mouth.
I wonder what she can fit in it.
3) Co-Star
Play Hot Mess Bingo with me?
So, there’s this party where if you get on stage, it means you want to get fucked.  Location-coded consent; I like that.
I like that too. We kiss whilst the client’s taking a piss. I sense that he feels left out.  He pays. I drink. He pays more... I drink her pussy up with a curly straw.  Where she goes, I can follow but he cannot.
You know; I think that’s part of the allure.
See you on stage Fuck Toy!

I love you.
and you are looking at me
like I am so so dirty
and you tell me
I smell like the strip club,
distinct,
hairspray and body spray
and sweat and other people’s
sweat.
You say you don’t
even want to fuck me
on the days that I work,
that you can feel
the other men on me.
and I already knew that
but hearing you say it
out loud makes it
so much worse.
So I always go home to shower
before coming back to yours
after my shift,
so it’s a good thing
we’re neighbors.
You are so accessible that way.
If I am drunk,
I won’t even think about it
unless you are begging me to come,
so you can hate it out loud
and in front of me
and still have me
sleeping next to you.
I swore to never change,
when the other girl in the dressing room
says
a man can never really be okay
with it, and love you,
I laugh
but here I am, washing myself off for you
and you tell me you can still smell it,
you can still feel it
and so the shower was useless
but at least I am trying.

relapse on drugs and alcohol,

click “Create New Character,”
and write the worst poem ever.
I don’t know how to make stuff
without him here to inspire me,
so I go ask ChatGPT,
“What’s another way of saying
‘I can’t think of another way of saying
“I don’t know how to make stuff
without him here to inspire me”’?”
but my phone (literally) blows up,
destroying every last neverlasting piece
of evidence that he ever even existed,
which makes this a whole lot harder
because now I’m too drunk and high
to remember what he looked like.
When I try to picture him,
all I see is “Error: User Not Found.”
It takes me a thousand hours
just to get the left half of his cupid’s bow right,
during which time l gobble up so many of these
baby blue black market downers
that my blood starts to dream about me
falling from my fourth floor window
onto a welcome mat made of metal spikes,
releasing it (my blood) back into the wild,
where it can breathe clean air again.
I’m almost finished, though.
Three freckles, two freckles, one freckle to go,
then there he is, as sexy as ever
and backlit by god rays,
coming to life at twelve frames per second
like a stop-motion Galatea.
And am I crazy, or is that his voice I hear?
Considering what he said last time,
I turn the speakers all the way down
and the brightness all the way up
while pulling the monitor closer
and closer (and closer)
to the lips I haven’t stopped OCDly peeling off
ever since that day he left me for her.
Outside, the stars are pixels,
and the night sky is a screensaver,
and the buildings are computer towers,
and each person is a virus.

I am scared of every loud animal there ever was.
Why make sound?
It’s so annoying.
I am scared because I live in a dome and I never see real grass anymore.

I saw a bus.
I saw Instagram.

I can’t change my bedsheets every week I can’t do my hair every day I can’t learn a new language by next year I couldn’t even pick just one I can’t check in on my sister I can’t finish the art historical readings on Venus
I am scared and trapped in this world.
I feel like I am the cut umbilical cord I feel like I never grew legs or arms or feet or hands I feel like I have never moved an inch.
I feel like I have always looked like this, a fake blonde with faded freckles and tired eyes.
If I am the thing that was cut off, then why do I feel so heavy?
Why did I stop growing but why am I bigger now?
Why is this burdening me like a death and eating me inside out like a disease?
I feel like an empty spray can of thermal spring water. No way to use me so one way to discard me.

How was I supposed to know

Shimmy-ing and shaking
Rising and falling

I’ve got horses to ride, Mister
I can't be getting silly in your nonsense,
I tell him
I can't get dizzied up in you
And so,
I just listened to him breathe,
sitting there silently
and still
It was his breath I always liked about him
The way it calmed me
The way it made me still,
just his breathing
so I listened for a good 22 seconds
and I watched the lights turn
Red
then yellow
and green,
eventually
I reached for my pocket mirror
checked for cilantro
smiled
listened to his breath
sucked on a cherry cert
colored my lips

I’ve never stolen anything truly meaningful. Not technically. I like things that make me feel like I’m holding a secret I’m almost too careless to keep—a bar of soap, its scent blooming from my bag, lace panties clinging together like a barrel of monkeys up my sleeve, coasters from a store too pretentious to notice they’re missing. A magazine at checkout, ceramic chopstick rests, a tube of lipstick, any shade. But I’m a careful person. For example, I wouldn’t take Colette’s coat. Real rabbit, she insisted. Found at an estate sale, because at some level, everyone knows the best things belong to someone else. She was still talking about it when she met me and Michael for dinner.
“It’s the most environmentally conscious thing to do,” Colette said, grabbing a menu. “Wearing fur, I mean. The fake stuff looks good, but it’s so much worse. It just stays there, in the landfill.
Forever
.”
Colette’s coat was slung over her chair. I thought about the sensation of the beige fur beneath my fingers, soft and yielding, its weight on my shoulders, its warmth pressing down on my collarbones, how tension feels when it’s drawn tight, the sting of pressure when it finally snaps.
“Since when did you care about the environment, Colette?” Michael peered around the restaurant for our waitress, a youngish girl with pencil-thin eyebrows who was, at most, spiritually present. “If you start thinking about what’s right and what’s wrong, you’ll never live. I mean you were vegan once, right?”
“For two years,” I corrected, raising an eyebrow. This was back when Michael and I dated, back when he was straight, back when I thought I could stop my hunger for things I shouldn’t want. We were both wrong, of course.
“And it was miserable,” he said. It wasn’t a question, but I knew he was asking for confirmation.
“
Miserable
,” I finished my drink. At the table next to us, a couple split a steak. I liked the
clink
of the knife as it met the plate, how quickly they sopped the blood and grease with a torn piece of baguette.
“That’s what I’m saying,” Michael said. “I hate to complain–I really do–about there being no such thing as ethical consumption, whatever, whatever, but at the end of the day, we’re
humans
with
needs
….”
The conversation drifted. Across the room, at the bar, a man in a suit unbuttoned his collar. He was politician-handsome, silver hair slicked back over a boyish face. Tall. Slender. I watched the motion of his fingers, his watch catching the soft amber light. I leaned in just enough to see him notice me. I pressed my thighs together. The sharp edges of my chair bit into my legs.
“And they’re doing all of that in a petri dish. Can you imagine that?” said Michael. “Lab-grown
meat
?”
“Yeah, weird,” I said. “Has anyone seen our waitress?”
Colette drummed her fingers on the table. “I think she went for a cigarette.”
“That’s the other thing,” Michael said, tearing into what little remained in the bread basket. “Nobody wants to work for anyth–”
“I’m getting another drink,” I said, rising from my seat.
An old mirror hung from across the bar, distorting my reflection as I slipped into the empty seat beside the man in the suit. This restaurant used to be different. People say that about every place you go to in the city, but there was a time when things were actually different—tables full of old men, regulars reading
the New Yorker
over plates of rabbit and ketchupy steak tartare in the back. The menu is the same, but nobody eats. It’s hard to have an appetite in a city that asks for so much just to give you a $26 martini to sip on under a framed photo of a B-list actor in return.
“Too loud over there?” the man in the suit asked. A tea candle flickered between us, throwing a soft light against his knuckles and two tumbler glasses, empty except for the remnants of something not quite orange or brown.
I said I’ve never stolen anything meaningful, and I mean that. In the beginning, I was just reallocating resources necessary in order to move out of a model apartment, and it was easy in the bars and the clubs, where jackets were piled next to tables covered in bottles of vodka and cranberry juice. Most of the time I’d find coke baggies, tubes of chapstick, and receipts in the pockets, bobby pins, gum wrappers, the usual garbage. Other times, I’d find some loose change I could dump into a mason jar in my room, a ring I could sell online, and if I were lucky, a wallet.
I always thought wallets were such strange, sacred things, the center of someone’s life and only mine for a fleeting moment. As I rifled through student IDs, loyalty punch cards, and neatly folded bills, I’d imagine all the choices that led their owner to me. Desire is like that, I think—an invisible thread pulling people through a series of seemingly justifiable events.
I tilted my head to get a better view of the man’s face. His jaw was sharp but softened with age. His eyes were a pale, near colorless blue. Almost foggy. Good. My pulse thundered in my ears, blood rushing so loudly I almost didn’t hear the faint clink of his watch against the bar as he gestured for another drink. He was saying something, but I couldn’t hear
what
. I smiled and watched his gaze shift from the bartender to my eyes, my lips.
I remember reading somewhere that all desire is rooted in shame, but I don’t think shame is a bad thing. Not in the way people make it out to be. Shame makes desire
real
. It makes you fuck people you shouldn’t and ignore the interest quietly building as you sleep and live off of dried fruit and green juice when all you want to do is sink your teeth into something that was once alive. My thoughts snapped back to Colette’s coat, how it would look on his floor, his tie in my hand, slipping free from his collar with a soft hiss–
I felt the weight of the watch in my pocket as I returned to the table with a drink I didn’t order in hand. Michael and Colette were still talking ethics, now with a bottle of wine between them. The man in the suit turned his head toward me. He smiled, raising his glass halfway in a silent toast. He didn’t realize it yet, but he would soon. Maybe in an hour, maybe in the morning. Maybe he’d convince himself he left his watch in the bathroom or in the back of a cab. Maybe he’d never realize it was me. These are the things we tell ourselves.

We met texting
We met online
Well yeah like messaging
I liked the way you wrote
Yeah but that was me like being thoughtful
Present
With it
It takes a lot to be
*Out of me to text
Like it’s a full interaction
And it’s in writing so I wanna either mean it or be funny
Like it’s one thing to fill air when we’re in person
Like talking
Together can be a game
Like breathing
But on my phone it feels
Like that can only happen when I’m really high
Or I’m like forced to focus
Bc I just like being in person better
Bc it feels more like now and more organic and like time is my friend and on the phone it feels like a fight for me to stay
And I just want to look away
I love talking
Like my ideal date is just talking somewhere comfortable
It’s like texting but out loud
It disappears
It breathes
Btw don’t use your towel

Why?

I'm in the acme, Browsing, Y’know,
Heading towards milk and dairy,
And the fish heads
Start whispering about me,
I try to ignore at first,
But I noticed their icy lips kept twitching,
Whenever I turned my back on them,
It feels like highschool,
“What? What is it?” I demand,
The guy restocking the frozen meat section looks at me with concern,
I pointedly ignore him,
The fish are silent,
“No, really”- I say- “What?!”
One fish pipes up,
We were just saying how good you look today, like- we love your hair!
I respond: “C'mon I'm no idiot, what do you have to say to me?”
They are silent a moment, then a mackerel slowly speaks,
Well...we were just wondering... who is that guy you have with you?
“Who, my friend?”
Yes!
They say,
I tell them
He is my friend,
My friend has gone to get chips and cucumbers,
“He is going to get cucumbers and snacks”
The fish eye one another,
Frozen still as they are they can still look about with ease,
Their eyes bright and fresh
“What?” I ask,
An employee, Restocking the Jiffy cornbread folds up an empty cardboard box and wanders to the back room with a nervous glance at me,
Look, we just wanted to show you this,
They start to flip and wiggle, hopping and slapping,
A big salmon half flops over,
A filet flaps and folds itself in two, to reveal
Underneath it,
There is a pussy,
On ice,
It looks young,
There is a little line of blood,
Seeping out from the lips,
We thought you might want to look at this,
the mackerel tells me,
“Yes”, I say,” I'm not surprised”,
Your friend brought us this last week,
And another one about a year ago,
“I know” I say, indignant,
“He does that sometimes”,
The fish stare back,
“It’ll be fine, he's getting snacks for me,
He’s kinda crazy about me actually”
The fish cannot shrug, but they would.
They roll back over,
Back to sleep on their hard bed of ice.

In Los Angeles you can see some strange things.
A gang member is eating a chef’s salad alone talking about “The Bears” to anyone who will hear him.
An Asian man sits four chairs down wearing the gangs sigil, unbeknownst to him.
He works in tech and drives a Tesla. “A Tessie.”
He tells the waitress, “You dont even have to press the brake for it to stop. It just stops. Elon baby!”
When he honks his horn “Drop It Like It’s Hot” plays. He has more money than my entire family combined.
The waitress has blisters. She has three jobs not counting Onlyfans. It was booming during Covid, but now it’s just creeps.
It was always just creeps.
I ask her if I can have more coffee but she doesnt hear me. The ghosts of Beverly Drive have her now.
I’m supposed to be meeting a girl from the canyon whose future lives somewhere in the valley of those hills. In the secret tunnels maybe she will find herself. David Lynch could have a field day in her head.
Across the room a man says, “I expect theater to come back in a BIG way.”
“Oh.” says his friend.
A table of four gays ordered four Oreo shakes as soon as they sat. Doubled down on the theater comment and now they are comparing favorite plays.
I swear I heard someone say Hadestown seriously and the table fell quiet.
I’ve never seen it, but with context clues that might be a faux pas.
More gays just got here.
The Hadestown comment really seemed to dampen the mood.
I try and cheer them up and they just glare at me.
My friend is now an hour late, and if she was on time I couldnt have written this.
Maybe it’s fate.
Maybe I’m always running a little bit late.
The last time I was at this restaurant I was with a girl that I loved.
We shared a BLT with mayo on the side. She prefers mustard.
I think about her a lot. Almost always.
I think her TikTok reposts are hidden messages just for me. But she hates me.
She told me.
Three times.
Sometimes when I look at my hand long enough I can start to see through it.
I start to wonder if other people can see through me also.

Me and the girls got all dressed up to sit on the pavement at the
corner of silence and revelation. People passed by and said
nothing, probably wondering why we were sat there in high
heels and children’s clothing. Foreheads gleaming in the
streetlight, we powdered our faces in tiny mirrors when
suddenly from the shadows appeared a man in rags. He asked
what we were doing and out his pocket pulled a button and
brass penny along with an incredibly smooth pebble. In a soft
and melancholic voice he began to carry the tune of a song
from his country. We told him we had no money and to leave
us the fuck alone. Told him we were waiting at the corner of
silence and revelation and wanted to do so in peace. The
makeup sat on our skin like drywall dust. For a second his eyes
were pools of sorrow then he fucked off. We were glad he was
gone and went back to doing our thing.

I live with a couple who fucks all the time.
They tell me they’re going to meditate,
then I hear moans leaking from under the door.
I’m convinced they’ve fucked
on the couch, the table,
and the living room floor.
I see when they look into each other’s eyes.
It’s its own form of meditation.
Their surroundings dissolve into a space
with no place no sound no people.
The only remnant of reality is the tear
that rolls down the face
and onto the bed in orgasm.
When they inevitably marry,
I will throw them a wedding
for all of eternity
where they can stare into each other’s eyes
and say “I do”
over and over.
I could never tell you
Jason Salvant
You don’t know
that I took a shot
before we went on our first date. I wish
I had told you then.
Now it feels like a sin,
as much of a sin
as reading through your childhood diaries,
as rummaging through your underwear drawer.
Can you blame me
for getting into my own place
through the fire escape?
A good friend of mine once said
her heart is a house, and
she often has to spray WD-40 on the lock.
My heart is a studio apartment in Brooklyn,
with the bedroom in the kitchen
in the bathroom in the bedroom,
a drummer upstairs,
an old couple downstairs,
and opera singers on either side.
A week before our date,
I went to a Terrance Hayes reading.
He said a poem is a house too,
where the attic
holds the context and the basement
holds the subtext and the living room
holds the people and the kitchen
holds the imagery and the bathroom
holds the self and the bedroom
holds the dream.
So here’s the dream—
a 3000 square foot apartment in Central Park South with a penthouse, a guest bedroom, an extra half bath, central AC, enough room for a dog, enough room for you, enough room for me.

How sharp it is
I think you’d smell like a cowboy
Facial hair, needles and haystacks
But we never get close enough for me to confirm that
I'd like to sip on you in this summer heat
We could color our tongues with otter pops
And mix the flavors, sticky sweet, blue 5 + red 40

starry eyed sea freak with no plan
no insurance
just a mermaid doll in a plastic box
everything would be so much easier
if i was being sold at target
my skin would be encrusted with glitter
my fingers would be fused together
so that my hands were always cupped
open and outheld
how can i write about anything else

after supper
you hunt me like a dog
dragging myself to you pathetic,
I beg for your sneer,
drool for those sharp fingers
your barbed tongue
you peel me apart
scrupulously
not letting a drop go to waste
strung high a skinned doe,
you clean your knife and watch over me
and I exhale into ether

sinking my legs into and around
your waist,
telling you
I want to be alone with you
upstairs
in the back
in a champagne room
no,
not in your apartment,
baby
please, baby
live in the fantasy
with me
do what you came
here to do
don't grind back against me
while I dance

just let me do my job,

the iron farm stopped working
two days ago
a rock got stuck in the pistons and the whole thing is left mid pain suspended defense
and now
you’re in the thick of it
-137, -1236
i make my way on foot
sleep without walls
take my chances in the dark oak
i have found ravines
i have fallen
i have broken axe
splintered bones
silk spool discard
i have found myself in dungeon again
and again and again
will silver come like copper
will ancient debris still sink
the iron farm stopped working again
and the jig is up
the train will stop running
come vine come vine again

Sturdy belonging, I need your
Heat lamp, my reptile skin
Rids me of my wrong-thoughts
I swear I’m thinking betterer
I dry heave this message in a bottle:
Come find me later
I’m not ready yet
I bury myself in a cave;
Ten thousand years of rock tomb
I feigned little urgency ‘til you
Upturn my backbone boulders
Hark the herald flock
I am your pet
This is my land
I come when you whistle
I make you proud

i think sometimes i’ll never be full.
i eat and eat and eat and eat and
it is so exhausting
to have my fill.
i’m watching a woman bite her nails through
the bus window
as she grips the steering wheel,
making a snack out of a habit.
i slip a penny under my tongue and cherish it,
feeling the tang round out my mouth
like an after-dinner mint.
i’m giving thanks and saying grace that it is over
but He knows i’ll have to do it all over again
the next time my iced coffee is lonely.

I’d gobble myself up.
For the weight I’m not happy with.
For not having enough money,
or success.
For doing too many drugs,
for sleeping with men I didn’t love,
for cheating,
for lying.
If I could,
I’d forgive myself.
I’m so happy right now.
Do my panties
smell sweet?
I’m so scared
of everything
going bad.
I’m so happy right now.
I’m scared to attach my poems in an email,
and I’m scared to get attached to anything.
I find Carnatic music beautiful, magical, calming. I feel like I grew up in Goa, India.
Every winter spent there since I was six did something to me.
Every day I’ve lived since the day I was born did something to me.
Every person I’ve met in my life did something to me.
Every decision I’ve made did something to me.
Every breath of mine—does something to me.

I can never post a video of you carrying me.
I’m too heavy,
Unlike the girls
you like.
Berlin,
You take and you give,
and you are so dirty, so beautiful.
You smell like cigarettes, trash, and drugs.
You smell like summer.
You smell like sweat.
And you give and you take,
And you love me so hard.
Coughing my lungs out smoking another cigarette for some reason I think that
nothing
will ever happen to me.
I have 4 boyfriends.
One’s my
father.
The second one is
dying.
The third one has very
long hair.
Another one used to have very
long hair.
They all showed me
how much pain I can take,
how much love I deserve.

I’m horny, I’m stoned
Sitting pretty on the porch
Pretty come home               Please,
Pretty please.
I want to hear rocks under tires
I want dirt in my mouth
I want sweat in the air
And jeans soaked in dust
Dish soap hands pressed palm to palm
Held to chest in gentle prayer
Pray for cracked lips against my fingers
And your fingers in my hair
Tangled up                          Make a mess
Trace the bruises + turn on the fan
Dance to its hum and pause
You sip your beer and light a dart
In my mouth, fall back on the bed
Like an Angel and I watch
Uncross my legs and
Wrap my arms around your head
Baby, I’m hot,
Pretty, I’m burning up.

where your head lay dreaming
on my arms, on my neck
in dry pools of crusted spit
your bad breath lingers,
i haven’t washed since i last saw you.
faded brass fingers and copper hair,
the first time you brought me to your room.
to impress me
you plucked clumsily
strung out like the chords

I stare at the pharmacy's pregnancy tests
searching for cheap,
accurate and comprehensible.
They are pink boxes,
attention seeking boxes,
happy boxes.
Voices approach my pharma-location.
Quickly, I turn my body in the opposite direction.
I search the faces of the voices' owners and find strangers.
A discovery that reveals my ridiculous shame.
In my hiding location, at the height of my eyes,
a bottle with a blue eyed baby smiles from the shelf.
The cardboard baby is not selling just a cough remedy, no.
He sells baby giggles, a joy filling sound
even for my undesiring belly.
He is untreatened by my cynicism.
The baby knows that if he wasn't cardboard,
I'd hide my face on my hands
and practice other clowneries in the search for his laughter.
I return to my tests' options.
Some of them are on sale. Is it a time of the year
with low baby-making-sex?
Does it mean I have less chances to be impregnated?
Or are these tests close to their best before date,
and so should I not buy them?
New voices take my body into hiding
–again I am with the still red cheeked, mid-laughter,
joy of someone else's life baby.
And again I see strangers and feel my ridiculous shame.
It begs people to understand:
"Please, believe me I know of Global Warming!
I am not trying to have a baby!!!" Or
"No, I have other dreams, I have modern dreams!"
The choice of test weighting like a fetus on my womb.
There are tests that can tell you're pregnant
six days earlier than others –for a couple dollars more.
I remind myself that my first nausea happened a month ago,
but can you imagine the rare bad luck that makes these 6 days relevant?
A rare bad luck that faults my IUD, can you imagine?
I take the couple-of-bucks more expensive test.
I bring to the cashier waterproof mascara
and the test. I pay in cash.
I put the test in the most bottom of my tote bag
–a strategic placement. But hiding is not enough.
I want to carry a more pleasurable object, a guiltless object,
so I leave directly to the fruterie besides the pharmacy.
And there my hands meet the convenience of a bag of grapes.
I walk around the aisles. I feel the lack of something amusing
and my trajectory must go on. So I line up at the cashier.
People line up behind me.
On my turn, it's revealed that the grapes were priced at 18 dollars.
In my hands I hold a twenty. I stare at the green plastic dead queen .
I stare at the middle-aged man at the cashier.
I say "I'm sorry, I changed my mind."
Instead of moving away,
I wait for the man to say something rude.
I keep searching on his face for a sign
of anger or vexation.
He stands expressionless. Maybe he even mutters an "OK."
But I can't quite tell and I keep looking.

weed defrosts me like spring in a bong
creativity, morning coffee,
i do my makeup better than everyone else
i write my poems with you
my best ideas
my ace of wands
at night when i can’t sleep
or when i can’t stop shaking
i’m making my friends ashtrays out of air dry clay for christmas
i don't mind the coughing, being the one to get the water
i love the movies the food tastes better you laugh for longer and you forget forget
and i think they said that Forgetting is the best medicine
i Worship you.
my Mom told me something about it;
she’s a hospice nurse
a senior woman had a tumor so bad her scalp was black and goopy
nothing on the charts could stop the aching,
her daughter in law slipped her thc oil
and the woman slept peacefully that night
i'm not saying i have brain cancer but i am saying that there is a fever inside me that i can't sweat out and a deep cold fist clenched in my chest and the doctors call it adhd and inherited depression my Mom calls it sensitivity my Boyfriend calls it my mom
a tarot reader says the Weed is blocking my intuition
i don't dream anymore
that's fine with me because when I dream i dream of stress
and dead childhood dogs
and the future
like in a sylvia plath way
everyone has their silly little Vices
Moms vice / Drinking / Working hours and hours
the little things it takes to get you through
i don’t question it anymore
it doesn't bother me anymore

Baby tell the nurse that the baby is coming
and I don’t have the nursery ready,
I don’t have a name picked out
and I don’t want to know the sex
and I don’t want to know the baby
because it doesn’t know me like that
baby tell the baby I don’t love you
and we’re too young and we don’t know what a baby is
baby tell the birthing pool we could only fill it half way because
last month’s water bill was out of control and it was your fault,
what kind of grown man takes baths every night
and baby, tell me baby,
what kind of baby would you like, because
maybe if I can, I can will myself to give you what you want
if that’s a baby you want baby, I can make a baby for you baby
to make you love me like you’d love my baby
but baby don’t call the baby your baby
baby
will you ask my baby why it destroyed me, baby?
why my stomach’s loose, why I don’t bleed like before baby?
but my baby is my baby, baby
you can’t help my baby like I can baby
I grow and make my baby grow with my body baby
the baby needs me more than you baby
tell the doctor it’s his baby,
that the baby will see him before it sees anyone
it’s not my baby and it’s not your baby, baby

and it was porcelain plastic
and it was placid pools of plumbing
and it was a thought of an impulse dispersed,
where again humiliation is forever
and so is that foot of metal
I kneeled over in distraction and broke skin
and thought
I’d remember this too
even if it hadn’t etched itself into my calf,
there would’ve been recognition
and it was a vial and then plastic again,
plastic always finds its way into memory
and it was the thought of a thought occuring
and the check and the in
there was humiliation there too:
when I thought I could take as I had taken before
it saddened me to learn that I had ever only taken
and what I took I didn’t have any use for,
and what I took I had taken before,
and what I could take I wouldn’t feel,
now that I must only fill

oh the rashes, raising

we flee the beach
talk of cheetahs for $65 bucks
but I could see that shit in Chinatown
for free
skirtfuls of cream
in a mussel shell
I’m on your rooftop, I’m white and blue
betraying false angelhood

rouletteish milk
on all the lives they could
reasonably have
but still somehow I have

You feed me a piece of steak, it’s so
embarrassing. It takes me ten minutes
to chew. If you wanted to shut me up
you’ve done it.
I was in so much trouble
for running away at the mall. They called
the mall cop and made me wear
a little backpack with a leash.
I’m doing the thing where I walk
in front of a moving car and stare
directly into the windshield like
how dare you hit me. It’s worked
so far. Maybe they should put me back
on that leash. You ask me
what I’m thinking about, my least
favorite question. It’s a sign of weakness,
the chewy tendons of that steak were once
the chewy tendons of the animal. The calf’s
wet nose pressed to my palm. I’m four years old
wandering through the pasture, covered in cow shit.
From this moment forward

I’m trying to stop
calling myself a girl, everything imbued with
its currency, I want my brain to move like a slot machine.
I am not afraid,
we were drunk driving down the coast, screaming
into the same wet lawns. Before my face even had a shape,
I knew myself for your foil, I liquify. Trembling within the vessel,
the melted tequila soda doesn’t mind when knees hit the table,
doesn’t mind being drunk, knows the cycle of its birthright.
We arrive here, at this brazen smell of thawing earth.
If I asked, would you jump that fence?
I can become my own kind of animal.
Two calves pressing four knees
and fear, I am forgetting how it tasted,
I am relentless in my spring.

you'd love to have my approval but it won’t be easy
you won’t impress me because i'm extra slow to warm up
if you like bad bitches that’s good to know
i know you like them in theory and then you go sad mode
when you encounter a very bad one
there's clearly something wrong with me
can you top that loser
i can’t accept compliments
i should have and express positive thoughts
i should be adorable but instead
i’m a conceited piece of shit
i don’t care if irony as practiced and spoken
during the indie sleaze era
is cringe now
i love vintage
and friends told me to
never change
and when i’m high i’m passionate
about being earnest

Nowadays no oracle needs to tell us:
It’s all winding down.
Just like nowadays we don’t need curses to look the truth
in the face and call her crazy.
Call her
alternative; delusional; toxic; whore
.
Your new oracle is a DJ. Your new oracle is a girl’s girl on TikTok with a synth
pop ass she shakes on OnlyFans for a sliding scale
Delphi, that magic chasm,
is like the pussy of the Earth.
Too much of a good thing will spoil anyone.
The truth is worth nothing since money’s all there is.

walk down a street where     everyone is slumped over
gallery girl watches from her perch     watches art we wouldn't buy even if we could afford to
a 200 dollar perfume ad reflected in a window
puts the face of a model on the woman
stacking steel chairs at the bagel shop     her sneakers sandy with poppy seeds
someone dragged a couch at delancey essex to lie your head     clean dry warm
200 lit candles on the stoop of the bodega     send a prayer
the flames lick at my legs     it’s too damn hot for christmas
that’s why everyone is somewhere else     even when they’re here

let's say i'm walking to my car after drinks
i powerwalk to it and look around
i take a video of myself and post it online for people to see
it only lasts a few seconds (no context)
living in the past is posting poorly-lit pictures
i post because it's dark and the parking lot is empty
only 4 or 5 cars are left on that level of the parking structure
i post the video because it's evidence
if anything bad happens to me
this video has been posted
and there are clues to use to find my body but yes
you're right i also want to show you my face
and you want to look at it
you are not the you in the poet’s poem

I stare into the fridge like I’m attending my own wake and staring into my open casket. Marble face. Blue-purple lips pressed together like irradiated, larval gummy worms. Alkaseltzer dissolving into my clouded eyes.
Maybe it’s an addiction. Who tf knows. All I know is Bbyangel says she can’t leave food around the house because it’ll be gone by the time she’s home. Like how I told her I can’t have beer or pain killers or weed in the house or else I’m gonna get faded. Had to impose an embargo. At least during the week. Because I just have to be in the same room as that shit for the fade to hit critical mass. To be on my
cabron
shit. And then things start to fall apart. But during the weekend, all bets are off. Sometimes it feels like my demise is an inside job and there’s no de-escalation once it starts.
Bbyangel says if there’s food in the fridge, she knows I’m gonna eat it. And that’s not exactly an unfair summation (or a ringing endorsement.) Painfully accurate tbh. It’s not even about being hungry most of the time. It’s more about boredom. I work from home now. Spend my day hitting the fridge up every hour or so and gorging myself. Say it’s just a “snack” like how I would just have a “beer” at lunch before they got wise and fired my ass. Some strays cannot be domesticated.
Housebreaking some strays is trying to Moss a stray bullet.
Never came clean and told Bbyangel what happened, but that’s neither here nor there. Don’t see why disclosing that matters. Wouldn’t change anything. Still, it used to be funny when I’d eat like that. Almost endearing. She’d shake her head, say, ‘Pinche vato,’ under her breath and just laugh. Lately it’s more of a problem. I eat and eat and eat, never leaving anything for her. Not even scraps. Though leaving scraps would probably be more insulting than anything. Like,
Wtf do you think I am, bro, a dog?
‘
Y las flautas? No me dejaste nada?
’ she asks when she gets home from the salon she works at, ‘
Comiste todas?
’
I talk in a passive mumble like a kid getting scolded and avert my eyes, like she neutered me and wears my severed nuts on a necklace to send a mfing message, ‘
Estaba alli…Tuve hambre…idk.
’
‘
Te dije que quiero comerlas cuando regreso del trabajo. Lo recuerdas?
’
She looks at me like I just peed with the toilet seat down (which, full disclosure, I might have done as well.) I wring my hands and look at my chancla-sheathed feet, ‘
Pues, si…pero…tuve un chingo de hambre…
’
I don’t really have anything else to say. Barely understand what the big deal is tbh. I’ve always been a Bermuda Triangle of shame. We sit in our cramped Tijuana apartment. Vomit-green walls and ramshackle kitchen tucked into one corner. A makeshift sink with a rack to dry dishes. Hot plate on top of the mini-fridge in lieu of a stove. Toaster in lieu of an oven with a dehumidifier that emits resplendent luminescence. Changes colors every few seconds. Microwave mounted like a TV in a
taqueria
. A giant shoe rack we use as a dresser and handrails converted into a place to hang clothes. Cold, unforgiving concrete walls like in a jail cell. Damp, suffocating air. Faux-wood flooring.
Outside, it’s car horns blaring. Dogs barking at dogs barking at dogs barking. Someone yelling for my neighbor
Pepe
outside his house every hour because doorbells aren’t a thing here. It’s what dogs are for lol. Dead ass. Doesn’t matter if it’s 2 P.M. or 3 A.M., someone’s out there yelling his name. The silence in our apartment is still more deafening than the cacophony outside. It’s altitude clogging my ears and cotton balls stuffed in my skull. Bbyangel tells me I have a problem. I know that means she’ll add that shit to the long list of amendments she’d like to make to my constitution.
Every girl has a list. And the lists never stop.
She wastes no time sending me to the editing bay. She never does and sometimes I think it’s what made me fall in love with her in the first place.
I light a cigarette and stare up at the white ceiling. Think this must be what she feels like when she prays and convinces herself God will sort all her shit out on her behalf, like he/she/they/it were just a cosmic fiduciary with a existential power of attorney. Only costs your soul to enlist their services. Surrendering to a higher power.
‘I have a plan,’ she says, ‘To work on this. Make a solution.’
She’s all about finding solutions. I’m more about pretending the problem doesn’t really exist in the first place. If it doesn’t self-correct, I’m more than happy to just let it fall apart. Like, maybe—
just maybe
—you can will these things into non-existence. Reverse manifestation.
‘What’s that?’ I ask. Somehow relieved at the simple prospect of a plan.
She’s always treating our relationship like a math equation or shitty car that keeps breaking down you won’t replace because you can’t afford to. While I treat it like a litter box in which I defecate and wait for someone else (usually her) to change.
‘We won’t keep food around the house anymore. Only when we’re going to eat. So you won’t be tempted. Maybe this is how you can learn to control yourself.’
The truth is this probably cuts her deeper than me because she metes out her love for me in food. Each dish is an overture. A literal expression of her love. Deprivation and over-indulgence are two sides of the same coin for me, and that coin, that emotional currency, is my love language.
Mi idioma de amor
. We’ve always had a tacit understanding of how this works. An unspoken contract that binds this relationship. Like, as long as one of those extremes is on the table and ready for me to dig in, we’re in good shape. As long as we have that
efectivo
, we won’t go bankrupt.
It sometimes feels like there are two people inside me: someone on the brink of death on a hunger strike for some undeterminable (but definitely
lost
) cause and someone who sees
My 700 Pound Life
the same way kids see making the league. The one on hunger strike, feeding the other all the food he’s petulantly refusing to eat in some twisted iteration of a feeder fetish, creating a toxic, codependent relationship with myself.
Btw, I’m thoroughly convinced most Mexican girls have a feeder fetish the way they stuff you with food until you’re practically insensate, at which point they conveniently always start difficult conversations when you barely have the energy to move let alone push back. But me? I just smile like a suture. Exhale a gaunt contrail of smoke. My lungs get tight. My chest starts hurting. My breaths get short and shallow.
I marvel at how she really
gets me
. I realize something in that moment:
There are two kinds of people in this world, her and everyone else.
Like always, I’m on board at first. We start going to Calimax and purchasing food like a Doomsday Cult thoroughly convinced the world will end each night.
Lately, every day feels like my own personal apocalypse.
You don’t know trust satiation—satisfaction—until every meal is your last meal.
Life hasn’t felt so good in a while.
We eat dinner with the intent of not having leftovers the next day. A license to binge for the entire night. Feel like this is what I was put on earth to do. Like what Jordan must have felt the first time he touched a basketball. I wake up the next day feeling gross. Practically hungover. I’m my own experimental DIY taxidermy project stuffed with excrement like a diaper instead of cotton. I step outside and light a cigarette. Yawn, burp, and stretch. Rub my eyes with the back of my hand.
The sun and clouds look sewn onto the sky like shitty punk patches on a denim vest. Scroll through my phone with a crack like a lightning bolt running down the middle. Retribution from a vindictive God. I start mapping out the freelance work I have that day and think about the conversation when I was stupefied by gluttony the night prior. Got into uncomfortable territory. Bbyangel is in therapy, actively works on herself. She’s all about self-improvement and bettering herself. Told me I should start doing things to give back to the world. Acts of service. She alleges it’d help.
I joked that this is new territory for me, and historically speaking, exploring uncharted territory doesn’t yield the most judicious or humanitarian results. Like, I’m just gonna eradicate and oppress whatever those mechanisms are I have yet to encounter. She hits me with a reverse
Uno
card and says it’s typical colonizer speak to equate my debased impulses to indigenous people.
What can I say? When she’s right, she’s right.
I draw more cards, apologize, and keep it pushing.
I wasn’t entirely convinced, but I capitulated. Even believed it almost. Usually when she talks to me about bettering myself, I say something along the lines of, ‘
You can’t polish a turd,
’ which apparently gets less funny each time I say it. Diminishing returns type beat. But I’d gone comatose and just laid decommissioned. Fish eyes. Breathing like a ventilator. Sometimes day-to-day living is being on life support for me. I listened to her like I was in a state of sleep paralysis and she was a grisly, shadowy demon visiting me. Couldn’t really rebuke or evade her. Just had to lie there and let her water board me with her care and concern like a wrongly interred prisoner. I’d gladly give up the answers she was trying to torture out of me if I had them. But I never do.
Though I’m by no means innocent.
Love sometimes feels like a stint in Guantanamo.
Cut to right now. She’s at work. It’s just me and Tuna, our cat, in the apartment.
No food. No brew. No weed. No Tramadol. No

Dank powder rain gives way to wet revelation:
though I’ve begun the process of prizing myself highly,
a smear in an unset oil painting adds something,
a glitch in a system.
A fire drill opens up a window for performative shivering.
Jumping from one cafe date to the next isn’t a cinematic way to live
is what I find printed in a book.
I’ve stopped trusting in postured fact. I prefer to lucky 8 —
I always want the soup of the day, even if it’s not to my taste
or burns my buds. I hate repressing.
The Duchess looked everywhere, till he ended her…
I’m grateful to live in the tropical suburbs
beyond the purgatory of a red drape or false wall.

why pretend not to fancy Monica Bellucci?

Sylvia standing on the other side of a glassy pond. Mayflies bobbing lazily across the surface. Sylvia’s full name printed neatly and sealed to the table with packing tape. Sylvia’s two braids tied back every day. Sylvia dancing on the patio. Sylvia hiding in the back of my closet. Sylvia in a tie-dyed T-shirt from sleepaway camp. Sylvia on a bicycle. Sylvia in an aquarium. Sylvia on the class field trip to the Bronx Zoo, where we sat by the lion exhibit all day. The gap closing between Sylvia’s two front teeth. Middle school pool parties behind Sylvia’s big, yellow house. Avoiding the weird statue that stared from the corner of her yard. Sylvia throwing a carton of milk at Logan Thomas. Detention with Sylvia. Sylvia promising she wouldn’t tell anyone I cried. That Halloween when we both dressed up as witches, the last one before stuff like that would matter. Sylvia’s new haircut, just above her shoulders. Sylvia’s white sneakered feet beneath the bathroom stall door. Sylvia through the window of a classroom—understanding I’ll always be the moon to her bright Sun. Sylvia’s warm cheek pressed against my stomach. Sylvia’s name like daggers from his lips. Buying makeup finally, like Sylvia always did. Sylvia in my nightmares. Sylvia on the phone. Suddenly noticing how tall I had gotten. A greying friendship bracelet in the back of my desk drawer. Sylvia on Owen Moore’s Instagram story. Sylvia asleep on my twin bed. Sylvia’s black Subaru, in my driveway less and less. Sylvia’s location, frozen at her house. Sylvia’s vacant gaze as I pass her on the street. Wondering if Sylvia ever liked me at all. Sylvia in the dark somewhere alone.
Sylvia’s locker unopened for months now. Sylvia’s prom dress on the returns rack at Goodwill. Sylvia’s face, placid and unaware, staring from the posters all over town. Three policemen greeting Mom at my front door. Having to admit a million times that I hadn’t spoken to Sylvia in a year or so. The silence after Sylvia’s name at graduation. Sylvia’s poor dad, alone in the tavern on a Tuesday night. Sylvia’s Subaru that her little brother won’t take. Sylvia’s birthday: I’ll notice every year. Owen at Sylvia’s vigil. Pictures from our middle school graduation on the local news. Sylvia’s Jansport backpack, found abandoned near I-81. Owen’s screams echoing down the school hallway. Sylvia spreading everywhere and onto everybody. Sylvia on the playground, blood running down her skinny shins. Standing by the bus stop, squinting against the rising sun to see where Sylvia went. Her small body and huge, pink backpack crouched by the side of the road. My eyes adjusting to the brightness, approaching and seeing a squirrel, squished flat on the road. I gag. Sylvia picks a daffodil from a nearby garden and lies it before the squirrel’s body.

God said “Let the earth bring forth every kind of living creature: voids, creeping things, wailing women.” And it was so. God made wild beasts of every kind and aching stomachs of every kind, and all kinds of things creeped on the earth. And God saw that this was good, which implies the existence of Not Good, which did not apply to the wailing women, the aching stomachs, the voids, the wild beasts, or the creeping things.
God went on to make other things too, like nail polish and Dark Souls 3, and God made death, too, just as they made life, for each portal into the world necessitates a portal out of it, creating life is the same as offering a sacrifice.

All six of them, shrunken small

hooves, like commas,
punctuate the extension

The bubble wrap pops, I can feel

opening the eye: a bright ruby
gleaming for me.

oh, and such
we sit and we blame God
and if God is not in your vernacular
it is our mothers at fault
and if it is truly not her fault,
such again we blame our fathers
or the creators before them
that bestowed their pain from summer loves
from devastation of a motor accident in the country
where you smoke cigarettes while your first sweetheart died
so in the room of plenty of victims
now suddenly you are the greatest one
when your biggest opponent is only the mirror
at last is it the blame of god,
or of your mother,
or your father
or any personhood of defeat-
as much as it is the enemy
resting upon your feet?
i baptized you in the bar sink
i sunk teeth into your shoulders
the valueless distribution of retention
my face is full of water
my palms are ferociously dry
i section them upon velvety curtains
scratching against the roughness of flesh
and they all want to be someone else
copious bodies but not enough souls

My girl; goddamn is she batshit.

I leave her to forage in the dust,
while I finger stacks of
dead lighters, doilies, pins, dice, wrenches, bobbins, tape cassettes, operation manuals, charging chords, and yogurt tubs.
She’s nicknamed the seller Spooky-Ron
he’s all beard and chainsmoke cigs.

holding back the webs.
Fate is settled in parking lots and moving sales,

Virginia is calling this ole western boy
to tame his sorrowed heart with a southern girl.
Her gift? He saved her two rusted ax heads
his thumb running along the corroded edge.
He’s a re-formed agnostic
his wife’s death set the sun on a closing world

crossing the continent to drown in them.

There was some intentional abstraction in my admission, yes, some light fudging, which might speak to my impulses more generally. Perhaps I have some spiritual insecurities that prevent the kind of transparency this setting demands. Pardon, for this Church is very new to me truthfully. I only went Transcendental one lover ago. We needed some hot dogma in order to lay our exes to rest. As for God, He was frank as ever. Right there in the words of nearly everything I picked up with pages.
Truth, goodness, beauty
. They waltzed into my heart like pretty triplets. I wish I could have conceived them myself.
The trinity virtues certainly sleep soundly in my heart, tucked to rest there, even in those moments when I head straight toward fanned flames. The responsibility is mine alone, although boyfriends can lay like welcome mats at the hearth of a bender. How far does the goodness of truth stretch? I do not always know how much to say, in this little tin of being listened to. I just have so much on my mind, least of all vague expectations of decorum, which very well may matter here. Containment has never been in my wheelhouse you see, just the opposite. The last God said I was quite the entertainer actually.

I saw a capybara at the zoo the other day sunbathing gracefully

One time a fox stole my dads shoe from the garage...
he is the shoe and I am the fox and I am whisking him away
He’s evil in this movie but unfortunately they squeezed him into beautiful pants
His beautiful crooked teeth... I just punched 15 holes in my wall who made him fix them
He just found out the results of his pregnancy test
What is there to laugh about like this... Close your legs... I’m sick
If he was a mosquito who landed on me I would have no choice but give over my blood...
Every time I see footage of him being pampered I delve down one of the pipes in Mario and start
punching coins and mushrooms
He will receive 16 packets of meow mix kitten food for utilizing his kitten sparkly eyes
This is what Aphrodite looks like on Mount Olympus

That’s the thing with an upward trajectory, you know it has to eventually take a turn. You should be able to pinpoint the shift but even cloaked in hindsight I can’t see it. There was us and then there wasn’t. Your new keys and a room temperature bottle of champagne. I told you if you took a sip while it overflowed and made a wish, it would come true. You asked me if I made one and I sheepishly said I made two. The first was for you to get naked and the second was for you to stay that way. I fear maybe I cursed my real one that day by making light of the act of wishing. I heard you have real furniture now, no more Chinease food on cold floors. That’s a shame, as it made you slightly more relatable in your shiny new castle. Secretly I guess I’m glad that I only got to see that side, plastic cutlery and orange sauce dripping from your lip. When it was empty it had never been more full, does that make sense? I wish it worked that way for people, as I am now as empty as can be.

Both here to provide you with fleeting joy
Bright but already dead
Bodega flowers
A ring on a hand that’s touched others
The perfect shade of red on a mouth that grinds from constant anxiety and vices
An illusion
To everyone and no one
Bright and dead on every corner
Wrapped in pretty cellophane to distract you from the fact that I am already gone
At the very least I can bring joy to another
Even if just in passing
With hopes that maybe my seeds will spread and I will  grow again

We sat and drank and

Was tenderly fucking himself with
A blue dildo and stroking

Having never bought Plan B before, I referred to the RiteAid cashier, a South Asian woman who looked to be clocking off. “Behind the counter, yes,” she’d answered morosely. I had been searching for them near the condoms in the feminine care/family planning section. Clearly this had been naïve. Instead, emergency contraceptives could be found amongst all the things that contained nicotine: cigarettes, gums, lozenges, chews. After my brief exchange with the cashier, I floated over to the frozen section for a pint of ice cream, returned to the register, waited in a short line, and was helped by a different cashier, an older, straight-backed, white woman with dyed hair. She casually placed the Plan B next to my ice cream without a word about it, rung me up, and intuitively began putting both my items into a bag, though I had not asked for one. As I turned to walk out, she said “God bless you” with a certain feeling.
I wondered. I assumed she overheard my question to the other cashier. Perhaps she was trying to treat me delicately as I was clearly unaccustomed to buying Plan B. Maybe I reminded her of someone. But there was a real care overlaying her few actions towards me, a care I have not always known to emanate from RiteAid employees.
I wish the same cashier had been there when I came back a week later to buy a 28-pack of Always Infinity FlexFoam Pads (Size 3, Heavy Flow). She had been insistent on FlexFoam due to her sensitivity to textures. And, I wondered, standing at the register, had the same cashier seen me, would she bless me again?

Here is my poem:
A scoop of Jamoca® Almond Fudge
On, not in, a cone
Falls off
He catches it
In his palms
Wet with tears
He offers the scoop
In his palms
Wet with tears
As if he’s offering
His virginity
Metabolism
Bronwen Lam
She sucked
And she slurped
Her t-shirt a tent
Her body
Beneath
A skeletal sheath
No curves
No fat
No milkshake
Would make
Her a woman
Pantry Fun
Bronwen Lam
Eating chickpeas from a can
I wonder if I’ll ever figure out
How to feed myself properly
How not to stand
In front of the cupboard
Long after the growling begins
Making random concoctions
To make it shut up
A handful of this
A spoonful of that
A mouthful of both together
I imagine the child
I do not have
Sitting on the counter beside me
Chia seeds between its teeth
Licking peanut butter from its fingers
Extending one in my direction
And offering me
A bite

It’s here, everything
Everything everyone has ever wanted
Everything everyone has ever dreamed of
And more
But love is lost
The only sacrifice
To live in this paradise
This Disneyland
This heaven
Where the people are the games
And love is the concessions

In my astroturf dreams
A baby lanternfly crawls on the picnic table
And I play hop scotch over the cracks in the sidewalk
My shins are bruised
But I’m still eating strawberry shortcake ice cream bars by the river
While the dogs howl at the pound across town
Back home I’m listening to the same song on repeat
Waiting for it to change my life
It won’t
But there will always be deviled eggs on Tuesdays
And the way you lift your head towards mine in the morning

All my slugs escaped in the night
I see the slime trails on the glass
But I can’t find them
There’s only one left now
There’s one at the bottom of the jar
He’s very important now
I tricked him with stale beer and
a leftover rose the color of a scab
He overslept the escape
The other slugs tried to wake him but he wouldn’t budge
His friends went on without him
And at the rim they looked back at him
with their long slug eyes
maybe he’s dead down there
maybe he died of loneliness
maybe he died drowning
maybe he didn’t care for freedom
the greatest freedom of all
I love you is something you can’t take back
I love you can trap infection
A wound can need light
and dry dry air
I love you can fix something that is very broken
For a while at least

The arms manufacturer is moonlighting as a poet, or at least some kind of meme artist, and the would-be writers are all turning into beetles as his guests do coke off the sleeve of a collectible copy of Joni Mitchell’s Blue on the sofa. In the bathroom, there are only mirrors no floor and a bottle of benzos and animals kept in a glass terrarium and a leopard stuffed and a hung-up mirror covered in hooker lipgloss kisses which have been collecting mildew like warehouse silk.
Oh, God please take me up to heaven and by heaven I mean please take me out of this city and deposit me in the forest to grow lean and gentle. I will kiss the soil a thousand times, and grow religious in some fashion, and I will then be clean and then I will try it all again but this time I’ll be smarter. There is some hedonism, there is some tragedy, there is something wrong, there is something beyond this city where we have too much, maybe there is something to be said for noticing it all.
