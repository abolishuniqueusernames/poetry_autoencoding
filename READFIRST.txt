Project: Learning about neural networks
I would like to learn about neural network both theoretically and practically. Currently, I am reading about RNN and would like to make my own. so my plan is to 0. What specs I would typically need to run small networks locally. 1. Figure out how to set up a python environment with the package i'd need. 2. Learn how to use GloVe to embed text into a latent space. 3. Learn how to design a neural network and train it. The task would be dimensionality reduction (have an encoder learn the best approximation to the identity) 4. Learn the theory at every step.
