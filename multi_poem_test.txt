I’m your cum
slut babe
all I do is
read muse tan
drunk off
day drinking
what if we kissed
at the weezer
wall on national
girlfriend day
I saw a pink thong
that says good dick
will imprison you
well I’ve been
imprisoned
by your intelligent one
aching for more cocaine
noir in my corset
we don’t netflix and chill
we tubi and fuck
august burns faster
than a birthday quickie
but at least heaven
is air-conditioned

Can you livestream
in the night hotel?
I’m waiting for you       in pigtails
and a tennis skirt. I’m at the foot
of everyone’s midlife crisis.
We’re in a post-Bret Easton Ellis world
the world we write is the world we live in
wasn’t that the New York School?
I’d have a Coke with you
but your teeth would rot.        Your teeth
are most precious     a neighborhood of
pre-gentrification dive bars to smoke inside.
People are afraid
to merge but this isn’t a freeway.
There are no signs
of life besides the bellhop.
We don’t have bags, only desires.
Drive us into the Hudson
in a rented Jaguar as I give you head.
My teeth stay hidden
Followers will theorize
our disappearance. Found footage conspiracy
Norman Fucking Rockwell
was born
a few blocks away. You’re buying an eighth
for fifteen. I’m drifting toward room service.
I would go out tonight, but my phone
isn’t charged.
I would go out tonight, but when
you return, we’ll just fall asleep.

to On My Way!
every time
you’re on
the bus
at 2:33 am
coming

from an open mic

weaning
off hard liquor
no one says
they’re so
fucked
up anymore
i’m fucked up
on missing you
i share my love
in bursts
of odd behavior
i don’t simp
i yearn
i cuddle bunny
i snuggle monster
i i former loiterer
now curled up
with eve babitz
until we fuck
i’ll never
remove
my négligée
