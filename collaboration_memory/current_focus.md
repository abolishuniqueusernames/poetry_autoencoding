### Next Immediate Steps - ADVANCED FEATURES

1. ✅ **High-Level API Implementation Complete**
   - Single-line usage: `model = poetry_autoencoder("poems.json")`
   - 6 architecture presets with theory-driven defaults
   - Complete test suite (6/6 passing) and documentation
   - 7 usage examples from simple to advanced

2. ✅ **Architecture Compatibility Fixed**
   - compare_architectures.py now handles LSTM vs vanilla RNN
   - Proper detection of model architectures from weights
   - Compatible with old (64D) and new (512D) models
   - Ready for performance validation

3. **Validate Scaled Model Performance**
   - Run compare_architectures.py when training completes
   - Verify improvement from 0.624 → 0.95+ cosine similarity
   - Confirm neural-network-mentor's diagnosis

4. **Test High-Level API**
   - Run api_examples.py with real data
   - Verify all presets work correctly
   - Test progressive complexity features

5. **Implement TODO Items**
   - Threading for parallel processing
   - Denoising autoencoders
   - Advanced architectures (attention, hierarchical)

### Mathematical Context - Theory Alignment
**Architectural diagnosis reveals critical information theory principle**:
- Information bottleneck theory: Compression should happen at intended point only
- Current issue: Double compression (300D→64D→16D) violates single bottleneck principle
- Fix required: Ensure hidden_dim ≥ input_dim to prevent rank deficiency
- Theoretical validation: 16D bottleneck optimal when it's the ONLY compression point
- Neural network principle: Hidden layers should expand or maintain dimension before compression

### Expected Training Outcomes
- **Checkpoints**: Saved to training_logs/ directory
- **TensorBoard**: Visualization logs for analysis
- **Best Model**: Saved based on validation loss
- **Gradient Stats**: Layer-wise health monitoring throughout
- **Reconstruction Examples**: Sample outputs for quality assessment
