# CURRENT FOCUS - ACTIVE TASKS

## Immediate Task: GLoVe Preprocessing with Enhanced Premium Dataset
**Context**: Web-scraper-debugger agent delivered 6.7× improvement in data quality, ready for core ML implementation

### Today's Session Accomplishments - MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH
1. ✅ Environment validation - poetryRNN conda env with spaCy, PyTorch confirmed working
2. ✅ Educational framework created - comprehensive Jupyter notebook with 12 exercises  
3. ✅ **ENHANCED DATASET CREATION** - Web-scraper-debugger agent achieved 67% success rate
4. ✅ **Premium poetry collection** - 20 high-quality alt-lit poems (avg score 23.6)
5. ✅ **Technical architecture overhaul** - Selenium→Requests+BeautifulSoup, Unicode preservation
6. ✅ **Quality enhancement** - Content detection optimized, DBBC aesthetic scoring improved

### Conda Environment "poetryRNN" Requirements

#### Core ML Stack
- python=3.9 or 3.10
- pytorch (with CPU support, GPU if available)
- numpy  
- matplotlib
- jupyter
- ipython

#### Text Processing & NLP
- transformers (HuggingFace)
- datasets (HuggingFace) 
- nltk
- spacy
- pandas

#### Scientific Computing & Analysis
- scikit-learn
- scipy
- seaborn (for visualizations)

#### Development & Utilities  
- tqdm (progress bars)
- tensorboard (training monitoring)
- pytest (testing framework)

### Next Immediate Steps (Priority Order)
1. **Complete GLoVe preprocessing exercises 4-8** in Jupyter notebook
   - Vocabulary construction with Zipf analysis
   - Co-occurrence matrix computation  
   - PCA effective dimensionality analysis
   - Pre-trained embedding alignment

2. **Download GLoVe 300D embeddings** and test poetry vocabulary coverage
3. **Implement RNN autoencoder architecture** based on dimensionality findings
4. **Set up training pipeline** with curriculum learning

### Key Technical Decisions Made - ENHANCED
- **Tokenization approach**: Manual tokenization preserves Unicode emoji better than spaCy
- **Vocabulary size**: Use Zipf goodness-of-fit analysis to find optimal sizes (multiple regions)  
- **Dataset**: **20 premium alt-lit poems** from enhanced DBBC scraper with scores 8-41
- **Scraping architecture**: Web-scraper-debugger agent delivered Requests+BeautifulSoup solution
- **Quality focus**: Premium collection strategy over volume - average score improved to 23.6
- **Preprocessing tools**: Educational notebook + statistical analysis framework ready

### Context for Next Session - ENHANCED DATASET READY
**MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH**: Web-scraper-debugger agent delivered 6.7× improvement in success rate with premium alt-lit collection. All preparatory work complete! Environment validated, enhanced dataset ready with 67% scraper success rate, educational framework built.
