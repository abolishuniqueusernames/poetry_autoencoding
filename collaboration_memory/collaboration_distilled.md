# PROJECT DISTILLED - KEY DECISIONS & CURRENT STATE

## Project Overview
**Goal**: Learn neural networks through building RNN autoencoder for text dimensionality reduction  
**Dataset**: 20 premium alt-lit poems with enhanced quality (avg score 23.6) ✅  
**Theory Foundation**: Comprehensive mathematical exposition complete ✅  
**Hardware**: Lenovo ThinkPad E14 Gen 3 (16GB RAM) ready and operational ✅  

## Current Phase: Step 2 - GLoVe Preprocessing Execution  
**Status**: POST-TRANSITION READY - Hardware migrated, paths fixed, chunking notebook executable  
**Environment**: poetryRNN conda environment operational on Lenovo ThinkPad E14 Gen 3 ✅

## Key Architectural Decisions
- **Approach**: Educational implementation first, then optimization
- **Framework**: PyTorch for neural network implementation
- **Text Processing**: GloVe 300D embeddings with dimensionality reduction
- **Model**: RNN autoencoder with 10-20D bottleneck compression
- **Training**: Curriculum learning (short sequences → longer sequences)

## Dataset Status - TRANSITION CONSOLIDATED  
- **Collection**: ✅ 128 poems consolidated (multi_poem_dbbc_collection.json)
- **Quality**: ✅ Alt-lit aesthetic preserved (avg DBBC score 18.7, range 0-43)
- **Volume**: ✅ 235,517 total characters, ~1839 chars/poem average
- **Format**: ✅ Neural network ready with metadata and content structure
- **Chunking**: ✅ Sliding window implementation ready (95% data preservation vs 14% truncation)
- **Infrastructure**: ✅ Full website scraper available for additional collection

## Theoretical Foundation (Complete)
- **RNN Mathematics**: Rigorous formulation with universal approximation
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Theoretical necessity proven
- **Sample Complexity**: Analysis showing dramatic improvement with reduction
- **Architecture Justification**: Autoencoder approach theoretically optimal

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Environment Setup**: conda + PyTorch + HuggingFace + text processing stack
2. **Data Analysis**: GloVe embeddings + PCA for effective dimension estimation  
3. **Architecture**: Vanilla RNN → PyTorch implementation → optimization
4. **Training**: Curriculum learning with gradient flow monitoring

## Next Session Priorities - EXECUTION READY
1. ✅ COMPLETED: Hardware transition and environment setup (poetryRNN conda env)
2. ✅ COMPLETED: Path robustness fixes in spacy_glove_advanced_tutorial.ipynb  
3. **CURRENT**: Execute chunking-enhanced GLoVe tutorial notebook
4. **NEXT**: Validate chunked output (~500 sequences from 128 poems)
5. **THEN**: RNN autoencoder implementation with 6.7× more training data

## Collaboration Context - CONTINUITY RESTORED
- **Style**: Direct, mathematically precise communication preferred
- **Standards**: Educational code, theoretical rigor, intellectual honesty about limitations  
- **Tools**: Use TodoWrite for multi-step tasks, reference specific line numbers/files
- **Memory**: Update throughout sessions, not just at end; trust the designed systems
