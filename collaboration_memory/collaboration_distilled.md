## Neural Network Implementation - SCALED ARCHITECTURE READY
**Previous Architecture**: 300D GLoVe → 64D hidden → 16D bottleneck → 64D hidden → 300D
**Scaled Architecture**: 300D GLoVe → 512D hidden → 16D bottleneck → 512D hidden → 300D ✅
**Fix Applied**: Encoder/decoder hidden scaled to 512D, eliminating unintended bottleneck
**Components Implemented**:
- ✅ VanillaRNNCell with orthogonal initialization
- ✅ RNNEncoder with bottleneck projection (but hidden too small)
- ✅ RNNDecoder with per-timestep teacher forcing
- ✅ Complete RNNAutoencoder model
- ✅ Curriculum learning scheduler (0.9→0.7→0.3→0.1)
- ✅ Gradient monitoring system with diagnostics
- ✅ Full training pipeline with checkpointing

## B+ Grade Improvements Applied
1. **Teacher Forcing Fix**: Per-timestep scheduled sampling (not batch-level)
2. **Gradient Monitoring**: Comprehensive layer-wise analysis with adaptive clipping
3. **Weight Initialization**: Orthogonal for recurrent, Xavier for input/output

## Current Training Configuration
- **Optimizer**: Adam (lr=0.001)
- **Batch Size**: 16 sequences
- **Max Length**: 50 tokens (adaptive with curriculum)
- **Epochs**: 30 with early stopping
- **Gradient Clipping**: 1.0 threshold (adaptive)
- **Data**: ~500+ chunked sequences from 264 poems
