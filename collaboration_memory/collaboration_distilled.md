# PROJECT DISTILLED - KEY DECISIONS & CURRENT STATE

## Project Overview
**Goal**: Learn neural networks through building RNN autoencoder for text dimensionality reduction  
**Dataset**: 20 premium alt-lit poems with enhanced quality (avg score 23.6) ✅  
**Theory Foundation**: Comprehensive mathematical exposition complete ✅  
**Hardware**: Lenovo ThinkPad E14 Gen 3 (16GB RAM) ready and operational ✅  

## Current Phase: Step 2 - GLoVe Embeddings & Text Processing  
**Status**: ENHANCED DATASET READY - Premium alt-lit collection with 67% scraper success rate  
**Environment**: conda environment "poetryRNN" validated and operational ✅

## Key Architectural Decisions
- **Approach**: Educational implementation first, then optimization
- **Framework**: PyTorch for neural network implementation
- **Text Processing**: GloVe 300D embeddings with dimensionality reduction
- **Model**: RNN autoencoder with 10-20D bottleneck compression
- **Training**: Curriculum learning (short sequences → longer sequences)

## Dataset Status - MAJOR ENHANCEMENT
- **Collection**: ✅ PREMIUM QUALITY - 20 curated alt-lit poems from Dream Boy Book Club
- **Success Rate**: ✅ 67% extraction success (6.7× improvement from ~10% baseline)
- **Processing**: ✅ Neural network ready format with start/end tokens (26,690 characters)
- **Quality**: ✅ Enhanced alt-lit aesthetic scoring (avg 23.6, range 8-41)
- **Technical**: ✅ Web-scraper-debugger agent delivered robust Requests+BeautifulSoup architecture
- **Analysis**: ✅ Ready for GloVe embedding analysis with premium dataset

## Theoretical Foundation (Complete)
- **RNN Mathematics**: Rigorous formulation with universal approximation
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Theoretical necessity proven
- **Sample Complexity**: Analysis showing dramatic improvement with reduction
- **Architecture Justification**: Autoencoder approach theoretically optimal

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Environment Setup**: conda + PyTorch + HuggingFace + text processing stack
2. **Data Analysis**: GloVe embeddings + PCA for effective dimension estimation  
3. **Architecture**: Vanilla RNN → PyTorch implementation → optimization
4. **Training**: Curriculum learning with gradient flow monitoring

## Next Session Priorities - ENHANCED DATASET READY
1. ✅ COMPLETED: Enhanced dataset creation with web-scraper-debugger agent  
2. ✅ COMPLETED: Premium alt-lit collection (20 poems, 67% success rate)
3. **CURRENT**: Complete GLoVe preprocessing exercises 4-8 with enhanced dataset
4. **NEXT**: Download GLoVe 300D embeddings and test poetry vocabulary alignment
5. **THEN**: Effective dimensionality analysis for RNN autoencoder architecture design
